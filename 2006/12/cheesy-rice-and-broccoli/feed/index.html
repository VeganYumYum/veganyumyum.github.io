		<description>[...] Cheesy Rice from VeganYumYum. I am interested to see if the cheese is at least somewhat cheesy-ish. Vegan cheese in one area where there is more work to be done in the vegan test kitchen. Maybe this is the answer! I ate this when I was little and it was a big hit. [...]</description>

		<description>The Vegan Cheesy Sauce seems rather interesting; something Bobby Flay would cook up. It might be interesting to experiment and create a few &quot;vegan pizzas.&quot;  Do you have any favorite pizza recipes that require the sauce?  You could give me some creative inspiration!</description>

		<description>Celine: Good luck!  Maybe feed it to him as a dip first and see if he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John:  I just put it on top like little spots of cheese, like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/303008110/&quot;&gt;Pizza&lt;/a&gt;</description>

		<description>Hey that looks pretty good, I&#039;ll give it a whirl one night. What do you do with it on pizza? I&#039;d want to use the leftovers on one.</description>
