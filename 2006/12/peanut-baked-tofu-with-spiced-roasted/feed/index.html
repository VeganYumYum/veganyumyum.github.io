		<description>I made a variation of the tofu with almond butter tonight and it was very very good!  So glad to have googled &quot;tofu &amp; peanut butter&quot; and to have found you.  I also had a few home grown yams left and had enjoyed a similar method of roasting with olive oil and sea salt at a high heat, minus the sugar and plus some rosemary.  The greens here were Chinese mustard greens with garlic, quick flash stir fried in the wok.  But essentially yours was the inspiration.  Thanks so much.</description>
