		<description>Wanted to comment - I just made that dijon sauce for our NYE feast, and I agree with you about the acidity. I skipped the honey and used another dose of maple syrup, but when I tasted it midway through I found it way too tart. Another dollop of maple syrup and it was fine.</description>

		<description>yay, i&#039;m glad you liked the bread!&lt;br /&gt;i love it that depending on which flour or beer is used, the results are completely different. it&#039;s always a treat, and i&#039;ve never had a negative outcome with this recipe. plus it uses the beer we might otherwise OD upon. ;p</description>
