		<description>I have a horrible reaction to onions so I bought some tight fitting chemistry goggles that I wear while chopping.  I look ridiculous but it sure does work!</description>

		<description>Rub your fingers over the bowl of a spoon to remove the onion odor.  Just thought I&#039;d throw that in for free!</description>

		<description>[...] into cubes (about an inch should be fine), cut an onion (if you need help with this, look here: http://veganyumyum.com/2006/12/how-to-chop-an-onion-fancy-way/). Don&#8217;t worry about the size of the onion too much, in the end it&#8217;s puréed anyway. [...]</description>

		<description>Everyone&#039;s got a favorite trick.  I find that lighting a couple of kitchen matches, letting them burn for just a moment, then blowing them out and holding them in my lips (unburned end on lips, of course) keeps the tears away.  I think it&#039;s the activated charcoal in the burned end of the match that absorbs the gas.  Or maybe it&#039;s just the placebo effect because I BELIEVE it works.  But it does.  For me.</description>

		<description>Or for a quicker freezer trick is to cut the onion in half and put it in the freezer for about 5 minutes before slicing or dicing. This will already help your from crying your eyes out when cutting your next onion!</description>

		<description>another great way to avoid the onions tears is to put the onion in the freezer about 30 min before you are going to need it.  this helps a lot even though i do find myself forgetting to do it before i need them a lot:)</description>

		<description>You don&#039;t really have to slice the onion parallelwise.  If you slice it thinly perpendicularly (new word), and then slice across the layers, you will have tiny dices already when the layers separate.  Saves time.</description>

		<description>I cut onions OUTSIDE because I am so sensitive to them. I love eating them... but my eyes will water for an hour or two after I have sliced an onion. Half the time I just shove them in the food processor and throw them into the sautee pan and put the lid on super fast... and immediately rinse the insides of the processor! 

Thanks for the tutorial. I will try it... outside. 

Love the blog!</description>

		<description>in fact the best thing to do to prevent onion sting in the eye is to open a window, and even turn on a fan next to where youre chopping, to allow the onion-gas to escape</description>
