		<description>Next time you&#039;re in LA, you HAVE to try Real Food Daily or Native Foods (if you haven&#039;t already). Those are two specifically vegan restaurants that serve incredible food. I cook vegan at home, and these are two of my favorite places to eat out. I think I prefer RFD to Native Foods, but they are both incredible. Now, they&#039;re a bit pricey, but well-worth it.</description>

		<description>The bakery section really is the only reason to go to Mani&#039;s. I&#039;ve ordered my mom&#039;s birthday cake from them for the last couple of years. She comes to visit from Northern CA, and I&#039;m pretty much always too busy between getting ready for her visit, and/or working to make her something myself. I&#039;ve been a vegitarian for over 10 years and the recent discovery of a pretty serious dairy allergy has finally helped push me into becoming a complete vegan. My mom is diabetic as well as higly allergic to glutin and mildly allergic to eggs. My step-father refuses to eat ANY veggies or fruit EVER. (Not kidding - he has terrible diberticulitus)... Anyway, Manni&#039;s is one of the few places I have been able to find a tasty vegan, sugar-free, wheat-free birthday cake that everyone will eat.</description>
