		<description>Hey! I&#039;m wanting to go vegan next year when I move out of my house, considering I&#039;m only 17 with no job, this is a problem right now, but I&#039;m def be going vegan once I can get into college. I&#039;m been surrounded by meat-eating, chicken frying, a-dinner-isnt-dinner-without-meat kinda family for my entire life. And I have no idea how to transform my mind and life into a vegan lifestyle. If anyone has any tips, please reply to this. I&#039;m sure a majority of people that visit this site are vegan. And I could use some help. :) Thanks!</description>

		<description>Hi, i made some tangelo marmelade the other day but it failed miserably - or rather I failed at it! :o)
Is it possible to reheat the marmelade to strain the undesirable bits and put it back into freshly sterilised jars.  i can&#039;t bar to see it wasted completely.
can you help?
thanks</description>

		<description>Got the Yum Yum App on my iPhone.  Finally decided try something and chose the Asparagus tart since its on sale this week.  It was Fantastic.  Made it for pinch and came back and made another for dinner.  It was so good I went to Amazon and got your book to see what else I can try.  Thanks!</description>

		<description>I have recently started tiptoeing towards veganism and I started a blog about my journey.  So glad I found you and your fabulous recipes.  I can&#039;t wait to try some of them.  I&#039;ll have to get your cookbook.  Great website.  Thanks for inspiring me to keep heading towards veganland.</description>

		<description>I posted this on your Facebook page as well - but  thought it really belonged here :

Was browsing through your book at a book store and could not put it down :) I love how every recipe is &quot;presented&quot; and how you included pictures for everything! Beautiful work! I had to buy it! :)

Thank you !</description>

		<description>Hi! 

I did not find out how to comment on your post so I ask you here instead; I love your recipie of spicy lemon pepper pasta with broccoli! I am trying to inspire my friends to go vegan and would like to share this recipie on facebook. Would you mind if I translate it into Norwegian, change the unit of measurement to litres and decilitres and suggest some alternative ingrediences which is more easy accessible while linking to your blog?

Thank you very much for posting and sharing your recipies! :-)

Best regards Therese, vegan in Norway</description>
