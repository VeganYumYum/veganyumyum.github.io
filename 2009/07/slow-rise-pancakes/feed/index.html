		<description>[...] slow rise pancakes with chile blackberry syrup and sliced banana; 1/2 small orange. the pancakes turned out rather strange&#8211;i think because the homemade soy milk was still warm when i added it, it made the yeast go crazy&#8211;but the blackberry syrup turned out delicious and would be perfect to bring to a classy brunch potluck.

		<description>I saw this recipe and had to make it. I never eat pancakes because I don&#039;t like the flavor and mouthfeel the baking powder gives them, so when I saw a yeast-risen pancake recipe that you start the night before, I had to make them. I admit I used non-vegan ingredients - a real egg; and instead of soymilk, water mixed with whey protein powder. I also just had to add a splash of vanilla extract.

These are the best pancakes I can remember eating. I had them with butter and honey this morning, and they made my tummy very happy. :)</description>

		<description>I&#039;m really not a pancake fan in general but these have kindled a new love for them. They literally melt in your mouth. Thanks for another scrumptious recipe that renders eggs, milk and butter obsolete in my kitchen.</description>
