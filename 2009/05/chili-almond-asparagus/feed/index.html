		<description>Just made this. Fab!
Added a little smoked salmon on the side for my carnivorous husband, but he loved the flavour of the dish so much he said he didn&#039;t even need/want the salmon. Win!!!
Thank you!</description>

		<description>Just found this today - half an hour before lunch - when I went googling for a change to my usual (very good btw) way of doing asparagus with chilies. This recipe had the things we love, but not all the ingredients we had in the pantry, we sadly discovered. Nevertheless, cashews stood in for almonds (just this once - must buy some more) and I had to do without the powdered soup stock (mine had unaccountably gone to an unappetizing rodk-hard [expletive] colour over the last few years. Go figure.). My dh is as thrilled as I am and so we are shopping this afternoon for what we need - including more asparagus - to make this winner again, next time as the author of it intended. It was stupendously exciting as we had it today; I can hardly think how much better it will be later this week when we make it again with everything as you have set out. Thanks so very much! Huge hugs.</description>

		<description>Love the blog and most of the recipes here, but!
It&#039;s &quot;chile&quot; not &quot;chili&quot;...take it from the land of Tex and Mex.
This particular misspelling drives me a bit nuts.

Chili is a dish, usually made of beef down these parts (although there is an annual vegetarian chili cook-off in Austin) and chiles.

A chile is, well, a chile, and if there are many, you have chiles.

This looks delicious.  Will have to try it sometime.</description>

		<description>I made this last night to bring to my grandparents house for dinner and I found that they were way too spicy for my new orleans tongue.  When I make this again, because I will... Im just going to cut back on the red pepper flakes!  Just a suggestion</description>

		<description>It&#039;s unnerving to have your blog down for so long.  I really hope that things are sorting themselves out, and you are getting the time and care you need.  We all miss your presence in our lives.  Be well!</description>
