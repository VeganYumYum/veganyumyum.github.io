		<description>I made these a little while ago for some family, who are not vegan. My one cousin claimed that they were the best cinnamon buns she had had in her entire life! I thought they were pretty fantastic. Although, if I made them again I would cut down a little bit on the sugar since I&#039;m not used to eating sweet things. But other than that, they were wonderful, the dough was so light and fluffy!</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been doing buns since my childhood and oiling the pan is something very interesting - must try! You should try this version, it&#039;s the most popular in Finland. The dough and filling are about the same but the shape is different. Here&#039;s a link for how to shape these buns: http://kotiliesi.fi/ruoka/reseptit/pullataikina</description>

		<description>OMG! These are AMAZING! My husband and I just made them - even though it took all day to make, it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! They taste better than Cinnabon! I do have to admit we got a little nervous when we were rolling the dough - the roll was so huge! But it made perfectly moist, HUGE cinnamon buns :) I&#039;m definitely making these for the next family gathering...and I am not telling them they are vegan until after they&#039;ve expressed their love for them lol. Thanks for the great recipe!</description>
