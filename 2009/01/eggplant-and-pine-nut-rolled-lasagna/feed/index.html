		<description>I LOVE this recipe. It used to be on my Vegan Yum Yum iphone app but it disappeared for some reason. If the app gets revised, I think it should be included again since it&#039;s not in the Yum Yum book. Big fan of you &amp; your recipes. Even my non-vegan friends and family members love everything I make from your recipes.</description>

		<description>Made this tonight. It was so easy and fun to make (as long as you&#039;ve got the time) and really yummy! I added some of the suggested variations like pumpkin and baby spinach in the filling and sundried tomato in the pine nut paste. I would have added some minced garlic to the paste if I&#039;d remembered as I just love garlic and felt it was missing a little something. Instead of the breadcrumbs, I sprinkled nutritional yeast over the top just before eating for a cheesy/nutty taste. I don&#039;t usually eat pine nuts and found them a bit strong (they&#039;re expensive where I live too), so I think next time I&#039;ll use 1/2 pine nuts and 1/2 cashews and see how that goes.</description>
