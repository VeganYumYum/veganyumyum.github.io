		<description>I stumbled across your book at Border&#039;s and it is amazing! I have to tell you that I have always been health conscious and have made several efforts to go comeplteley vegetarian. However, it never lasts long as most of the recipes I could find were bland and without enough substance to keep me satisfied. Your recipes are satisfying, very delish and made with accessible ingredients. I can&#039;t thank you enough for being the catalyst for a sustaining life enhancing change! You certainly are a creative genius (and your photos are gorgeous too!) . Take care  and nurture yourself as you have a true gift. I hope you get high profile exposure so that you can change more people&#039;s lives for the better-Oprah??</description>

		<description>I recently stumbled across your book and all I can say is WOW!  I&#039;ve tried several of the recipes and have loved them all.  I made the picnic sandwiches for my husband and me to enjoy on the deck this 1st springlike weekend.  I am vegan but he isn&#039;t and he liked them as much as I did.  Can&#039;t wait to toss a few in the backpack next time we go hiking.  Thanks.</description>
