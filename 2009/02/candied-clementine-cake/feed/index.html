		<description>We just made this cake and it was incredible!  We didn&#039;t have clementines, but candied kumquats and cranberries worked quite well!  Thank you.</description>

		<description>Made this on Friday due to an abundance of clementines in my organic fruit delivery and it came out great - very moist. I worried after boiling the clementines that they were *very* bitter, so I increased the sugar somewhat (to 1/2 cup). 
 I followed the recipe for the icing, which was fine, but when cutting the cake, the icing just broke off so I just served the cake with a side of icing instead and no one complained :)
Thanks!</description>
