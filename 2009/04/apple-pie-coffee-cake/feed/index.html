		<description>[...] Apple Pie Coffee Cake: Let this cake cool for a bit before cutting and you’ll be surprised how easy it is to serve; the cake holds up really well and doesn’t fall apart when slicing. It would be really nice served with a little scoop of vegan ice cream. From VeganYumYum. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Another thing I bought (in “El corte Inglés”, like the oil) is Indian green tea. I love tea, and Russian people drink a lot of them (almost more than English!), and this time I wanted to invest in a really good green tea (yeah, today I spent too much money, I know. The dangers of living in a capitalistic world) and I saw that lovely box of wood with imported Indian green tea inside.  You can see it on the photo above. I could not resist and opened it in the train. It smelled like heaven! I can’t wait to taste it (translation: I will post a recipe of a dessert soon. Probably this apple coffee cake) [...]</description>

		<description>This smells delicious, I&#039;m having a hard time waiting for it to cool!  My batter wasn&#039;t as thick as the pictures show here, but I hve a feeling it&#039;s going to taste great none-the-less. Yum!</description>
