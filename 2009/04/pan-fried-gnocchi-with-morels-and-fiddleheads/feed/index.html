		<description>I live in Somerville and found some fiddleheads at Harvest in Central Square last night! 

I couldn&#039;t find any morels so I picked up some trumpet mushrooms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurotus_eryngii) at whole foods, and made this for lunch; I added some garlic to it as well. Really awesome - and it went over well with my boyfriend, too!</description>

		<description>Thanks for this great recipe! It inspired me to try something &lt;a href=&quot;http://veganbrew.com/2010/04/08/jets-de-houblon-aka-hop-asparagus-and-mushrooms-over-gnocchi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;similar &lt;/a&gt;using hop shoots instead of fiddleheads. An awesome meal for the return of spring.</description>

		<description>With morrels at $28/lb, I&#039;ll consider myself lucky to live in Saskatchewan, Canada, where I can pick them in the forest in my backyard!  Thank you for the delicious recipe!</description>

		<description>During the final saute, i added a shot of whiskey and let it reduce down--the way it interacted with the potato created a rustic-tasting creamyness. amazing flavors!</description>
