		<description>wow, I&#039;m so glad I found this.  As a kid we had a Japanese exchange student and her parents sent over a dessert for us.  I was the only one of my family that liked it and I&#039;ve been searching for it for many years.  It was made of a bean paste and something else that looks like the texture of your mochi made into a roll.  and it was sweet but not too sweet and I can&#039;t wait to try this to see if its the same or similar.  what makes me excited is that if this is what i&#039;m looking for you just gave a microwavable recipe which would be perfect for me since i&#039;m so lazy :)  thanks so much</description>

		<description>i heard a lot of people saying that &quot;cheap&quot; mochi (made from the rice flour instead of the traditional way) turns out slightly grainy in texture, rather than the chewy gooshy floofly goodness that i hear so much about.
is that true with this recipe? anybody tried it?

boy, i hope not because i love the idea of cheap, convenient mochi :B</description>

		<description>Ry-Guy, in this case, I&#039;m pretty sure that the &quot;glutinous&quot; in the rice flour just means that it is very sticky, like glue. (GLU[E]tinous)...and, let me tell you, it is indeed very very very sticky!</description>
