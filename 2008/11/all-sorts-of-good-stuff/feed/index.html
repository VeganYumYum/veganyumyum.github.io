		<description>Hi!  I found you after downloading the iPhone app and just wanted to say it&#039;s a great app and a fantastic site!  While I am still a Vegan conversion in progress, this site and the iPhone app make it a lot more fun, exciting, and easy!  Keep up the great work!</description>

		<description>Congrats on all the news!  The iPhone app is fantastic!   It makes shopping so much easier. I was in the grocery store the other day and saw some beautiful asparagus.   I whipped out the Yum Yum app, found the Asparagus Tart recipe, picked up the additional ingredients and hubby and I had a fantastic dinner.</description>

		<description>Agh!  Amazing!  I&#039;m so excited about the iPhone app that I can hardly wait to finish this sentence and navigate away from the page!

On a slightly less fangirl note, since I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve ever commented here before, your blog is completely masterful.  I love the balance you&#039;ve been able to strike between staples, special occasion meals, and how-to&#039;s.  And, of course, the photography is gorgeous.</description>
