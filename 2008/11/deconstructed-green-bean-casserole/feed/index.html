		<description>Over here in Kentucky we make our onions by splitting them with a tool to where each piece of onion kinda looks like fries but they&#039;re still stuck together at the base of the onion. Then we batter and fry, the serve hot with a dip. Idk what kind of dip, but we call this a Bloomin&#039; Onion!</description>

		<description>Well, I made {a non-vegan version of} this for my family for Thanksgiving, and needless to say they were impressed. I had some trouble timing all the different elements of the dish to come out at the same time--the onions took FOREVER to fry! I think it was probably the pan I was using. 

Terrific recipe, though, and while I may not ever have the energy to attempt it again it sure made me look fancy in front of my grandparents. Thumbs up!</description>
