		<description>I started out on this cake with great excitement but was bitterly dissapointed with the final result . The crumb topping was ok , but the cake was a tough , rubbery layer . I followed the instructions carefully , as I know vegan cakes can be a little tricky ......still not a good experience overall.</description>

		<description>I made this, but sadly I put the 1 3/4 flour... and now the crumbs are rock hard. I&#039;m so confused. Well I&#039;ll try again!!</description>
