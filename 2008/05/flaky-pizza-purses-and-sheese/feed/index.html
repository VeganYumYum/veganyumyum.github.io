		<description>It just seems kind of wrong to use Teese. Could you please read this article?
http://nothoney.com/2009/06/15/vegan-cheese-is-just-as-inhumane-as-dairy-cheese/

Also, if you find the article interesting, this site for Teese cheese, has a link to your vegan yum yum page and they just shouldn&#039;t.

&lt;3 to all vegans!!!

		<description>my local whole foods just started carrying sheese...I got the mozzeralla I just tried it melted with tomato sauce on a pita...I too have a dairy allergy...I miss mac and cheese and pizza.  I like follow your heart soy cheese also...I have learned to make a good mac and cheese with it.  I will try some of the other flavors of sheese it seems to melt well.  I will also try the pizza purses they look good.</description>

		<description>This looks delicious!  Although as someone who grew up just outside of New Haven,CT, I take issue with your statement that Chicago is the land of the perfect pizza pie! ;)</description>

		<description>I agree with Louise Gray--I miss my cheese! I am not vegan but rather have been diagnosed with a dairy allergy. Not sure if I would have found the &quot;dairy depravation&quot; easier if I had chosen to become vegan rather than being thrust into making these choices. I have not tried the Sheese (yet), though I have tried the Teese. Eating it plain I found it had only a very faint soy taste, but it was very...&quot;buttery&quot; is the only word I can come up with. Not really mozzarella like, but not &quot;gag&quot; worthy either. Not too bad on pizza. I will try the Sheese in the hopes that I can occasionally have some mac and &quot;cheese&quot;!

I would also like to say this is a great site! Though this is the first time I have left a comment, I have come here often and find it informative and interesting!  Thanks!</description>

		<description>I am have decided to go vegan recently due to food allergy test results.  I am a personal chef in Chicago and love cooking!  What are some  good vegan cookbooks?  I have Skinny Bitch and the recipes seem easy enough, but there have to be others with easy recipes.</description>

&lt;em&gt;Yup, they&#039;re vegan!  I wouldn&#039;t use them if they weren&#039;t &lt;/em&gt;:)</description>
