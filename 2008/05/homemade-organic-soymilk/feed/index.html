		<description>I was taught that in order to prevent such a &#039;beany&#039; flavor you have to bring the beans to 170-180 degrees and blend them at that temperature with water of that temperature. It has something to do with enzymes and starches. Then you should bring the water/pulp mixture up to a simmer slowly, never letting it actually boil, maintaining this for 30 minutes. You should also add at least 1/8th of a teaspoon of natural salt (make sure its natural salt that has no iodide and no anti-caking agent as this will make it bitter) for every quart of finished product.</description>

		<description>Hi!  Our family has been using soy milk for about 25 years - from powders to the commercial Silk types, and I&#039;ve been teaching cooking classes for 30 years.  In February I finally bought a SoyaJoy G3 and love it because you can make cooked as well as raw milks.  I have found that Country Life Natural Foods in Pullman, Michigan, has organic soybeans as good as Laura&#039;s.  We compared milk made from both Country Life and Laura beans, side by side, and could not tell the difference.  So that&#039;s what I use, and they are way cheaper.  I don&#039;t remove the hulls either.  If the beans are good, you don&#039;t need that extra, time-consuming step.   TOO MUCH WORK!!!  We experimented and found the milk to be the same with and without the hulls.  If you use some millet and rice with your soybeans, you can get a great tasting milk.  And of a touch of salt, good organic cane juice crystals, and vanilla makes it heavenly!</description>

		<description>I know this page was released quite a few years ago, so im a bit late but, the beamy flavour probably came from the mixture not being cooked enough, yes maybe from no lid as it couldn&#039;t retain the heat. When it&#039;s not cooked enough it can become bitter or beany flavour.</description>

		<description>When first making soymilk, it came out with a beanie flavor to it. I tried covering up the bean flavor with splenda and vanilla. Still, not to good. I once spent a week removing the skins off the beans, Still no good. Almost gave up making soymilk. Now I just soak the beans for a day or two and do the following. Comes out great. Best soy milk I have ever had.

One day I came across an article on making soymilk. Said to blanch the beans in 1-2 quarts of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of baking soda for 5 minutes. Do this twice. 

Note: I use two pans. 1 large enought to hold 6-8 quarts of water, to boil enought water for making the milk, and a smaller one to blanch the beans

Recipe: 
1-cup soybeans soaked in cold water for about 8-12 hrs. Rinse often.
Blanch the beans.
Note: 1-cup dry beans turns into almost 3-cups after soaking.
Mix 1-cup soaked soybeans on hi speed in a blender with 3-4 cups boiling water for 5 minutes. 
Note: You must hold the cover on real good or it may explode. I put the cover on and take out the middle piece for adding ingredients off. You can cover the hole with a cup or paper towel. I have not had a problem mixing with the small hole on top uncovered.
Repeat with the rest of the beans. 
After mixing, put in a large pot, and bring to a boil. Stir often.
Adjust the heat and simmer for about twenty minutes. Stir often.
Strain the mixture with a fine strainer. Some use cheese cloth. 
Makes about ½ gallon.
You could add some splenda, vanilla, or brown sugar to add some flavor to it, while you cook it. I found that once I got the beanie flavor out of the milk, it didn’t need anything added to it.</description>

		<description>my only advice would be to try to wean yourself off the commercial stuff.  i&#039;m chinese/vietnamese and grew up drinking only the real deal, so when i tasted the boxed soy milk, i couldn&#039;t believe it was being marketed as soy milk!  hope you give it another chance.  i love making my own at home too.  this method requires much less straining and is super easy:  http://kissmyspatula.com/2009/12/20/fresh-homemade-soy-milk/</description>

		<description>What I ended up doing was combining several recipes. I first rised my beans to get any chaff out of the beans,  then soaked my beans (1 cup) with about 1/8th tsp baking soda for around 12 hours. I then rinsed and gently rubbed off any skins. I continued rinsing the beans until there were no skins remaining. instead of boiling and grinding the beans I used my soymilk maker. I then started straining the milk until there was no residue left and the milk would pass through a very fine strainer. I then added vanilla syrup for flavoring. It came out a very smooth soy milk that was similiar to unflavored or slightly vanilla soymilk. one drawback was that the one cup of beans ended up making 2 cups of milk.</description>

		<description>There are as many recipes and ways of making soy milk as there are traditional Chinese/Japanese/Korean/SE Asian households.

Heat the beans a for a couple minutes in a microwave once you have them hulled. If the hulls don&#039;t come off easily, soak the beans a little longer. You may have had a particularly dry batch (this ain&#039;t an exact science).

Add a TOUCH of salt, this can improve flavor. I happen to like vanilla and almond soy milk, so I add a few drops of extract and some honey/brown sugar/sugar, depending on the mood I&#039;m in.

I prefer homemade, both the taste and the cost. My problem is that I haven&#039;t found a source for dried soybeans :-).</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t really like Silk soymilk... I have to mix it equal parts with rice milk to be able to drink it straight, but man... Soymilk in japan is just So Good and in many flavors and probiotic drinks that I hit up the konbini every 2 hours when I&#039;m there. xD... That said, the closest thing I have found in the u.s. Is kikkoman&#039;s Pearl brand... But you should definitely look to Japanese cookbooks for inspiration on homemade soymilk :)</description>

		<description>Hi, I just found your blog. I don&#039;t like commercial soy milk at all - Rice Dream is the only commercial milk-substitute I&#039;ve found that we like. BUT I do like the soy milk we&#039;ve made in the &quot;$100 machine&quot;.  Doing it by hand looks like too much work for a regular basis for our large family. But the machine is so simple and makes good milk very quickly and easily - soy, nut, even rice - though that took a while to &quot;perfect&quot;. And, except the soy, I can do them all raw, which I REALLY like. So we don&#039;t do soy often, even though the machine does it great. We usually make raw nut or nut/rice milks. The machine paid for itself in just a a few of not buying commercial non-milks.</description>
