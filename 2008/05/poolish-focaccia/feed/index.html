		<description>[...] Coming back to the topic – While doing my mini research on Focaccia , I came across mentions of recipe for “Poolish Focaccia” by famous “Bread Baker’s Apprentice”.  The book really looks good and recommended by many people – Goes on top of my “Books &#8211; I must buy” list. I found many different blogs/ posts with mention of same recipe and as always, everyone had their own way of executing it. I am going to use my learnings from each one of them, but this one can be considered as my main inspiration – Vegan Yumyum [...]</description>

		<description>Your foccacia looks absolutely beautiful!  I&#039;m a foccacia lover for years and always wanting to make it at home since the only place that I had a great foccacia was about 15 years ago inn California, at a small, local restaurant.  Ever since then, no other place offered good foccacia bread!

I made this bread using a recipe from Joe Pastry site a few days ago and baked it last night.  Mine turned out just ok.  My main problem with this bread is when I mixed the poolish with the flour the next day - the dough didn&#039;t seem to rise properly.  It risen just about an inch and that was about it.  I&#039;m still not sure how to fix it but I guess I&#039;ll have to make it again!

Thanks for posting and for sharing this wonderful recipe - I&#039;m sure lots of people do appreciate it!</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been wanting to make this bread so bad, but since I don&#039;t have the book I couldn&#039;t make it. I didn&#039;t know what the poolish recipe was. :) Now I do. Thanks for posting it! I&#039;ll be making this soon.</description>

		<description>just made this today and it is wonderful!  Love your pictures. thank you : )  Someone asked about Active Dry Yeast - that is what I used, in the same proportions and it worked just fine.

I topped with caramelized shallots in the last couple minutes of baking.  Yum!</description>
