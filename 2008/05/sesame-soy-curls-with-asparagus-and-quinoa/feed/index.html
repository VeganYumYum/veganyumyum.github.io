		<description>Thanks so much for this. I was a bit afraid of the soy curls (I got them as a gift), but your recipe made it easy and delicious to love them. I subbed frozen broccoli for the asparagus (still to early, I think), and it was so good that my faux meat hating boyfriend loved it too.</description>

		<description>Amazing recipe and flavor mix. I adapted it with Couscous instead of Quinoa and Zucchini instead of Asparragus. It was really good. The Zucchini took a soft sweet taste which combined amazing with their bitter taste. 

Amazing recipe,
thanks!</description>

		<description>This was perfect, I wanted to find something to use up my asparagus and try quinoa. I couldn&#039;t find any soy curls so I used store-bought mock duck. It was super good, even a few days after.</description>
