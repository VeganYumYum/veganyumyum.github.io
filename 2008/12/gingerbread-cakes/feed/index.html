		<description>I am trying this recipe for the Holidays..!! Thanks for sharing...
Not sure if anyone has shared this with you, a trick I learned when it comes to icing...freeze the cake first and then icing hard to places like the the sides or a cake that will produce crumbs...

		<description>I know its way after Christmas, but I just noticed these.  And mmmm do they look good.  I wonder if it would be possible to make these in a muffin tin and then cut the muffins in half and put icing in between o.o  Or maybe they&#039;d stick too much :/ I don&#039;t know, but either way I&#039;m going to try them :D</description>

		<description>Gingerbread cakes! It reminds me of childhood - but then of course the winter holidays always remind me of childhood. I like the sides bare btw - that way the taste of the ginger has its way with the taste buds! Five pounds to go and then . . .  Have a wonderful 2009 - and I&#039;ll be visiting here more often, you bet!</description>

		<description>Wow these look fantastic! I&#039;m going to try them as soon as I&#039;ve lost the weight I put on during Christmas time hahaha! I assume I can use non-vegan ingredients in place of the vegan ones?</description>
