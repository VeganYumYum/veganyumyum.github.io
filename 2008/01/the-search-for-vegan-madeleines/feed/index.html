		<description>Hi! I found this searching the web for vegan madeleines. I veganized a recipe from my mother in law and I used only sugar, flour, lemon zest, and Ener-G. I thought they were really good!</description>

		<description>Hey! I&#039;m on the search for a dairy-free madeleine as well. A quick search led to your blog. I DO have one recipe from the Wheeler del Torro&#039;s &quot;The Vegan Scoop&quot; (AMAZING vegan ice cream ) has a vegan madeleine recipe, I haven&#039;t had the time (or kitchen) to use it yet... but if you&#039;re willing to taste and alter, send me an email and I&#039;ll type up the recipe! I&#039;d paste it here, but I&#039;d rather coerce them into buying his book. ;) Best of luck with madeleines!</description>

		<description>T-H-A-N-K  Y-O-U for this:  I am on the hunt to veganize most of my rich recipes as I LOVE to cook and have had to seriously modifiy my cooking style since becoming vegetarian.  

I really appreciate your efforts!  I made Madeleines years ago pre veg and they were delicious.  Now making them for Xmas and I think I&#039;m gonna have to go standard this time based on your results - thanks for trying!!

Good luck</description>

		<description>[...] Madeleines are one of my most favourite things. Yes, Proust would be proud. I love these delightful tea cakes so much I named my first born after them. Really. [...]</description>

		<description>You&#039;re photos and blog, in general, are so beneficial to my cooking and sanity. I appreciate your dedication and sharing with us all the trial and error part to cooking. Isn&#039;t that just how it is? We all have favorite tastes and our ethical standards! Thank you!</description>
