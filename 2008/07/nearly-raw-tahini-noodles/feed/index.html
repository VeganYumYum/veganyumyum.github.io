		<description>Me too!  Arrowhead Mills has been my favorite brand of tahini for ages.  Tastes great, good stats, and it doesn&#039;t turn to concrete, as the others will.

But! (minor chord) It&#039;s disappearing from store shelves, and it&#039;s no longer available on the Arrowhead Mills web site.  I fear the worst.  Can you still get it in Boston?</description>
