		<description>[...] As I flipped through the book, I quickly realized that my usual post-it note system for marking &#8220;must make&#8221; recipes was not going to fly. My post-it notes were running low, and what&#8217;s the point of marking every single page anyways? With a beautiful color photo (taken by Lauren herself!) for every single recipe&#8211;recipes that are not only mouthwatering, but healthful and easy&#8211;can you blame me? Plus, sweet potatoes and chickpeas abound in Yum Yum&#8217;s recipes, which pretty much sealed the deal. My first venture into the book wasn&#8217;t even my own&#8211;my mom made the Miniature Napoleons with Eggplant Cream, a.k.a the cutest appetizers in the world, for a good friend&#8217;s birthday party. If you don&#8217;t have the book, the recipe&#8217;s here. [...]</description>

		<description>Today I used some leftover eggplant creme as a pasta sauce and it was excellent - a bit pesto-like. I let the creme come to room temperature, cooked the pasta and then added it, a little olive oil and the drained pasta back to the pan over low heat. Stir to combine for a minute or so and you are good to go.</description>

		<description>These are unbelievably good. So good that I am now getting requests for them! The eggplant creme is fantastic but I recommend making it a day or two in advance if you have the time - the flavours get even better. Another post mentioned that it would make a good ravioli filling, I think I will have to give that a try with the next round of leftovers :-)</description>

		<description>I tried these last weekend - had a mixed gathering - some vegans and some meat lovers.  I made these for the vegans using the large portabellos.  They were fantastic!!!!  The meat eaters were fighting over the ones that were left!! :o)</description>

		<description>Made these tonight and they were amazing! We live in Sydney Australia and it is too hot to use the oven right now so we grilled the veggies on the BBQ. I served these on a bed of lemon-scented couscous. SO GOOD! This tasted like something you&#039;d get in a high-end vegan restaurant in NYC or something. Very fresh/healthy but creamy and rich. That cashew cream is ridiculously good! Using it as a ravioli-stuffing would be amazing!!! I was literally licking it off my spatula. I&#039;ve been vegan for 15 years and this is easily the best recipe I&#039;ve ever made. Thank you!</description>
