		<description>[...] Seitan is great for grilling because it really holds up well. If you ever loved barbeque ribs, you&#8217;ve gotta try SusanV&#8217;s Barbecued Seitan Ribz. If you prefer your seitan skewered, Vegan Yum*Yum has a lovely looking Tamarind Seitan Kabob. [...]</description>

		<description>The tamarind flavor intrigues me a lot, I like the sour flavor and I think my friends would love to try this dish. I never tried using tamarind flavor so I&#039;m somewhat excited about how it will end up tasting. I guess I&#039;m gonna use variety of veggies on this but the broccoli looks great. I think carrots and some bell pepper would be great. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.</description>

		<description>Random Q: I have been looking for a hearty beef-like stew and I am so new to the vegan movement :) Could I use this recipe for your cubes in a stew? Has anyone tried it? Would it work? I guess I should just try it! Love your recipes BTW!!!</description>

		<description>I cook a lot of SE Asian and indian foods. I used to use the concentrate, preferring the convenience over tamarind pulp (which comes in a block and has to be processed with hot water). But once I tried the pulp and discovered what an entirely different flavor it has--I never went back to the concentrate. The concentrate has a dark, bitter, molasses-y taste, while freshly-made &quot;thick tamarind juice&quot; has a tart, fruity flavor. All you do is take a 1&quot; block of the pulp and pour over 1 cup of boiling water. Let it sit for 15 minutes or so, until cool enough to immerse your hand, and then squeeze and massage the pulp until it&#039;s as dissolved as possible. Let sit another 15 minutes to thicken and then strain out the seeds.</description>

		<description>This was awesome! I couldn&#039;t find any agave nectar, however in Canada we have lots of maple syrup so I used that instead. I loved being able to have ready-to-eat seitan in 10 mins. All of the other recipes I have used get you to make this big seitan log and cook it for an hour. The other thing I really liked about your recipe is that the seitan chunks were very tasty. Again comparing to other recipes the broth has been more flavourful than the seitan. Great job!</description>
