		<description>Thanks so much for this - it has become a favorite in our household! 

To the person who was asking about using Rice Milk - I always use it, and the grunts have tasted just fine. If you want it to be creamier, maybe you could experiment with pureeing a tiny amount of cashew and adding it to the rice milk. The flavor would probably compliment the blueberries quite nicely. I haven&#039;t tried this though, so again, it would be an experiment!

		<description>I have grown up with this recipe in Nova Scotia, the recipe I use is basically the same except:
I reduce the heat to low and cover, do not add any water (the berries have enough moisture and create their own juices) stirring occasionally.  The lemon juice is not a must.  Also a little (not too much) grated orange rind or lemon rind added to the biscuit topping is nice.
Cheers!</description>

		<description>This looks oh so good! Simple question, can soy milk be substituted for rice milk? I think I have a slight soy allergy so am considering substituting soy milk for rice milk, at least in dessert recipes. Any thoughts on this?</description>

		<description>Blueberries went on sale and I jumped at the chance to try my first YumYum recipe. They turned out absurdly delicious and were the easiest thing to make. I ended up using mini bundt cake pans cause that&#039;s all I had and aside from the oozing over onto the baking sheet, there were no problems with them. This recipe made me feel confident about trying other recipes from this blog, starting with the Sweet Chili Lime Tofu! :D</description>

		<description>Just made this tasty treat - my boyfriend and I aren&#039;t really big blueberry fans but we loved it. I was worried about how much liquid was in the blueberry mixture but the biscuit top really soaks it up - absolutely fantastic.</description>
