		<description>Looks awesome and i&#039;m sure it tastes sublime! I recently made my own invention of wonton soup... The dumplings themselves were filled with jiucai (chinese garlic chives), five-spice baked tofu, cellophane noodles (made of mung bean), shiitake mushroom, a little bit of shredded carrot , and some chopped water chestnuts, lightly seasoned with tamari and sesame seed oil.  The broth i cooked them in was a simple concoction of chai tea (steeped from a tea bag) brewed with ginger, tamari, and a small spoonfull red of miso paste. I cooked the wontons in a slow roiling boil of the broth for about 5 minutes, added some chopped greens (anything will do, i used napa cabbage that day but any green such as kailan, spinach, kale etc...will do) along with some roasted seaweed.  Simply delicious! I hope someone out there will try this recipe and let me know how it came out for em. Adjust seasonings (salt &amp; pepper, sugar,chili etc) to your liking.  bon apetit</description>

		<description>So I made this soup and before I even got to try it I spilled an entire boiling hot bowl of it on my leg and then after getting another bowl choked on a piece of broccoli before I even got to the wontons!

But in the end, it was all worth it. These were amazing!

I will (carefully) make these again and again!</description>

		<description>I just discovered your blog and have been to it many times in the last two days!  It&#039;s beautiful!  So where do you find vegan wonton wrappers?  The ones I&#039;ve seen all have egg in them.  I&#039;d love to make this!</description>

		<description>I have your page marked as a favorite and I visit it at least once a week. I love all of your recipes and I think you do an excellent job explaining the how-to of everything. 

PLEASE write a cookbook so I can buy it. The world needs more vegan chefs like yourself. You&#039;re just a class act.</description>
