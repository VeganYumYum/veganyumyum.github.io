		<description>I recently made raisin and then cherry Scones, after taking some friends around my home in England and realising what an institution Scones are in England. 
I used to eat them and Clotted Cream before I went Vegan. But have really been missing out! I&#039;ve so far veganised the scones using a traditional recipe from a Flour Mill in Winchester. 
I haven&#039;t attempted the cream...Clotted Cream is like a super thick, rich, yellow, fatty, smooth, cream with a strange layer on top. I still have no idea how to recreate it. 
Your blog post is lovely and traditional.</description>
