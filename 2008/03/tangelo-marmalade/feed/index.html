		<description>I tried this method/recipe and it did not work for me at all! It tasted great, but never &quot;set up.&quot; After I had done all of that work, I started looking into other marmalade recipes, and ALL of them mention pectin. 
I&#039;m very new to canning, and this was my first time making marmalade. I like to think that I can come to vegan blogs for help in this, rather than turn to other sources, which are likely to mention gelatin...however the omission of even the suggestion of pectin now strikes me as rather strange. Now I have 10 jars of...zesty orange juice that I don&#039;t think is even thick enough to be a glaze. 
I love your site and have tried other things on it, but this was disappointing. I like the recipe and will try tangelos for marmalade again--with pectin, this time.</description>

		<description>I think the crumb cake looks yummy-nummy!  I&#039;ve just become vegan, now about a month.  My receipes are currently over and over.  Now,  I have exciting new ones I can see.  I&#039;d love to try your Nearly Raw Tahini Noodles.</description>

		<description>You remided me of my mom&#039;s marmelade. It does take a long time but it is so worth it! You captured the colors and the process perfectly!</description>

		<description>How about Bergamot Marmalade!?!  I think we&#039;ll have to wait for bergamot season next year, but I&#039;m so excited! (But in the meantime, Blue Chair in the Bay area makes a good one.)</description>
