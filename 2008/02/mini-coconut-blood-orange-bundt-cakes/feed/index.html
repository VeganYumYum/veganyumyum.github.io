		<description>I have these in the oven RIGHT NOW! I can&#039;t wait till they are done. I am excited about this recipe because I haven&#039;t seen a recipe like this that doesn&#039;t use tofu in it. (I&#039;m not a fan of tofu in my deserts)

I licked the bowl and it taste so good already.

Your amazing :)</description>

		<description>When I made this I was so-so about it. Our friend had given up chocolate for lent so I made this, but secretly I was thinking &quot;Who even likes non-chocolate cake?!?&quot; This was amazing! It has become *the* cake people ask about the recipe. :)</description>
