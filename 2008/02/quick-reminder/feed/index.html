		<description>Congratulations! I am glad that you are able to share your passion for food with all of America! :) However, I am disappointed about Martha&#039;s snideness towards vegan food, her statement about the ease of your method of craft for the marzipan sweaters, and how she told the audience to go on her website in order to find your food blog url. 

It&#039;s wonderful and relieving that there are still kind, thoughtful, and talented people like you in a country where mainstream media is cold, calculating, jealous and greedy. I am reminded of snow white and the evil queen. ;-)</description>

		<description>Congrats on being on the show and doing so well!  A little nerves makes you look human and puts you in touch with the audience.  I think it was a great piece!

Pity they didn&#039;t mention your blog on air though!</description>

		<description>Hello,  Just wanted to say well done!  You did great.  I love your blog.  I&#039;m a long-term vegan who loves baking . . . and think I&#039;m pretty good at it.  Your website, descriptions, and photos . . . are so impressive, it makes me feel proud just to know you&#039;re out there.  I live in Scotland, and I refer everyone I know to your site - for inspiration, or even if they just need cheering up.  Thank you.</description>

		<description>Aww. I think the slight nerves made it charming. And somehow made Martha seem less brusque than she often does.

I&#039;m always so impressed with others&#039; creativity.  I completely lack a crafty gene, so it is fun to see what those who are crafty can come up with.</description>
