		<description>The prop food used for hasperat were actually flour tortillas, which were layered with cream cheese and filled with red and green peppers. The tortillas were rolled and sliced before being served.

From: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Hasperat

Doesn&#039;t sound particularly briney or spicy. Unless you have your taste buds set to bland and you find peppers spicy.</description>

		<description>This is going to seem like a dissertation on hasperat, I am a very big fan of star trek, being born in 1966, when it all started. I came up with the idea of doing a recipe book for the franchise, when I was young, and as the series continued and we were introduced to new series and new aliens and cultures, the list kept getting bigger and bigger, etc.  I actually tried to replicate those gel food items from the 
original series, I was around 8, or 9, when I did this and it was a hit with the family, i.e. jello and fruit, but I used half the water. Sorry, I digress,  Hasperat, as you know is a very spicy meal, and I will give you my 2 versions. The first will be the vegan version , for you, you start with green peppers , sliced 1 quarter inch thick, do the same to the red and yellow if you can get it, onion is optional. You split 50 - 50 your favorite italian dressing and half of your favorite hot sauce. You must be a 50 to 50 mix, thus the spicyness. Fry in a pan on low to med heat till you get your desired crispyness. warm your tortillos and spread softened philadelphia cream cheese over entire tortilla, pack with your goodies, and enjoy. I do one thing else, which is optional, I add lettuce done in a chiffanode style for filler. For the meat lovers version, it&#039;s the same,except  that you cook the meat in the first round, with the 50 to 50 mix of hot sauce and your fav itailian dressing. and then add the peppers, yada yada  yada Please include me in your recipe book. I have quite a few.other ideas that may excite you.</description>

		<description>We made these for our Star Trek party, and instead of using horseradish hummous, we used regular hummous and added a strip of horseradish along the center of the tortilla, and then a few drops of Sriracha chili sauce.  I LOVED these sandwiches so, so much.  I could eat them daily.  We have hummous sandwiches freqently, but I never was excited to eat them.  Now I dream of them!</description>

		<description>I hope you make a Plomeek soup recipe!  When my vegan mom and I went to the Star Trek Experience in Las Vegas, we ate at Quark&#039;s but we couldn&#039;t have anything except drinks (or maybe salad if we had felt like grilling them on the dressing).  What do you have for Vulcans?  Any Vulcan food?  --we asked the Ferengi waiter.  Uhhhh, salad? was his response.  Blargh.</description>
