		<description>Martha, I would love to have the pattern for the sweater you wore on the show of Feburary 25/08.  I fell in love with the sweater you had on. I see there are other gals who liked the sweater as well. I especially liked it because it made you look very thin! And I need all the help I can get!

		<description>I just saw the show.  You did a fantastic job!  I love it when guests can stump Martha with their creative process.  Great job having her think you knitted the marzipan to create the sweater!  Congratulations!</description>
