		<description>[...] I filled them with what I usually use as a dumpling filler when I make them with my family: Chinese style scrambled eggs, chopped up prawns, and a nice big bunch of garlic chives. You could use normal chives I guess, but garlic chives really do make the filling special. You can grow them easily in a large pot (most garden places sell the seedlings too) or get them at Asian supermarkets, where they are usually in stock when in season (late spring to autumn I think). However, there are a myriad of things you could fill them with, just search google or tastespotting or foodgawker for potstickers and you will be overwhelmed with possibilities. Vegans can be satiated with veganyumyum&#8217;s beautiful and immensely helpful guide. [...]</description>

		<description>The pot stickers sound and look great. Have you thought of trying to make them with gluten-free seitan? I&#039;m going to give it a go.

		<description>Thank you! I hardly knew what pot stickers were before I read this. I finally found the right kind of dumpling wrappers, and made me some with shredded, sauteed cabbage and grated tempeh. OMG YUM. These really blew me away. :D</description>

		<description>as a professional chef myself,  I say you did an excellent job. I added green onions to mine and made a began sweet and sour sauce for it. Quick tip, only pleat one side of the wraper. This is traditional, as well as serving the purpose of keeping the filling in and air out. 

The photographer in me loves your pictures, great job!!</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t believe how much better the homemade version of this is!  I prefer this to the thick wonton wrappers a lot of restaurants use.  These remind me of tibetan momo&#039;s!!!</description>

		<description>Wow, I love pot stickers. Definately a family favorite. I&#039;m all excited, I never thought I could make them out of scratch. BTW, I got a hold of a great cookbook for making seitan. A book from a couple of monks, simply heavenly is the name of the book. They have great recipies for broths the cook Vital Wheat Gluten in. I discovered you can just make the broth and soak the gluten for a day in a plastic container with a locking lie. Then shake the gluten ball like a paint shaker in a hardware store to make a hard seasoned ball. You can press the ball into a frying pan for a crisp pattie or steam it in a pressure cooker. I&#039;m gonna try to make some pot stickers, sounds, sooooo good. Thanks!!!</description>
