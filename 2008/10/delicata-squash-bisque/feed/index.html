		<description>Bisque is also sometimes used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill.</description>

		<description>[...] Delicata Squash Bisque &#8212; This one&#8217;s from a sweet site (with gorgeous photos) called Vegan Yum-Yum. We&#8217;re not a vegan household by a long stretch, but this soup is wonderful &#8212; truly fall in a bowl (thanks, Katie!) It calls for a &#8220;cashew cream&#8221; to add texture &#8212; I might have had my doubts about this, but not after tasting the finished product. You can make it with other kinds of squash, too, but if you can seek out delicata, do. Fab flavor. (Photo by Lolo at Vegan Yum-Yum) [...]</description>

		<description>[...] The thin skin is a great asset, in my opinion.  It makes it easy to prepare (you don’t need an axe and and a tree-stump to cut up this squash), and you can even leave the skin on and–get this–eat it after baking! But besides the skin, the flesh is golden, sweet, and smoothly-textured.  It’s perfect for just baking, or blending into a lovely silky bisque. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Delicata Squash Bisque: And man this is a lovely bisque. This is rich, full-bodied, yet very, very simple. So simple you won’t believe how such an easy soup can taste so wonderful. I use a cashew cream (one of my favorite tricks) to give this soup a velvety rich texture and creamy flavor that won’t disappoint. Start with a high-quality vegetable broth and this will be your favorite soup of the season. From VeganYumYum. [...]</description>
