		<description>I just made the kaju katli and had the same problem: it looked like it wasn&#039;t going to harden. I added some flour (making it a little more dough-like) and let it cool in the pot before laying it out on the foil. it hardened up right away! try that :)</description>

		<description>I also (like #47) had this come out sticky and gummy... delicious, but very gummy.  What did I do wrong?  I am a very experienced cook, and make many vegan desserts, but I&#039;m not very familiar with candy making (cooking with sugar syrup). Kaju katli has long been one of my all-time favorite store-bought desserts, so this result was especially frustrating!  I really want to master this as it would be great to know how to make this for friends and family!  Are there any further hints you can provide to help me get the consistency right?</description>

		<description>Silver foil is not even vegetarian, and far away from being vegan. Google for it and u&#039;ll know. Its better to skip it.</description>

		<description>I just made this too, and mine looks nothing like your lovely pics above. It&#039;s more like cashew brittle (without the nut chunks). Not sure how you managed the cookie-like texture that&#039;s pictured. (I didn&#039;t knead and roll either.) One thing I did that did seem to work... I poured my boiling mix on to a Silpat mat, so very easy to remove once it cooled.

Thanks for your great site - we&#039;ve tried tons of your recipes and they&#039;ve all been so delicious and (mostly) easy.</description>

		<description>I just made this - but it turned out too gummy to cut and remove from the foil!  What did I do wrong?

It is delicious though, so worst case, I&#039;ll just eat it off the foil with a spoon. :-)</description>
