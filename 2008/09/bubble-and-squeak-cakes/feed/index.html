I made Lolo&#8217;s (blog author) BUBBLE and SQUEAK. According to Wikipedia, and Cathlin you should know this, Bubble and Squeek is &#8220;is a traditional English dish made with the shallow-fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner. The chief ingredients are potato and cabbage.&#8221; Here&#8217;s her picture (and mine looked just like these.) Delicious. Very filling. And I&#8217;m not worried that if you google Bubble and Squeak the second entry is a recipe from &#8220;TWO FAT LADIES BUBBLE AND SQUEAK&#8221;. Theirs has lard in it.  [...]</description>

		<description>thanks so much for this recipe. I tried doing bubble and squeak quite a few months ago, thought it would be easy as pie - just boil and mash the veg, but the mixture was sloppy and they turned out horrible. I wanted to try them again, as I think my kids will love them but have been too scared! I just found your recipe, and am so glad I did!! Now I know what to do and hopefully my mixture won&#039;t be sloppy!

 I am going to get that Iphone app now too!! Thanks again!!</description>
