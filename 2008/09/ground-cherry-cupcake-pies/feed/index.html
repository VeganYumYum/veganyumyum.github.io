		<description>Thanks, these look lovely and yummy. I never made cupcake pies before, so this might sound like a stupid question, but what do you mean with &quot;removing them from the cupcake tin to cook completely.&quot; Does that mean that when the 30-35 minutes are over, I remove them, and then put them back into the oven again without the tin? For how long? Thanks for enlightening me!</description>

		<description>I also just discovered them at my local farmers market &amp; used them in a fresh corn salad. They inspired me to invent a hispanic style dish: Fresh corn off the cobb, finely diced serrano, green onion, tomatoes, ground cherry, lime juice &amp; cilantro. It was definitely yuuuuuuuuuuum!!</description>

		<description>Yummy these are, I used to buy and eat at the movies raw discarding husks to theatre floor ( naughty I was) But the best use for them is in a Pastry pie dont forget to add sugar thou, this is awesum. You can also stew them. I used some once with tomatillos plus a few other ingrediants and made a yummy chutney.They make a terrific jam, you can add apple for the pectin level. But what I would really like to try is a wine made out of them... I tried once to make some, darn near blew the flagon to bits doing so---- I drank it but it wasnt done well (professionally would have been better)</description>

		<description>Wow-wowee-wow!  I am SO impressed by your great cooking skills, this fantastic idea, and your photography. Gorgeous!!! I&#039;ve been wondering if I could make pies or crisps in little cupcake tins because I do much better when baked goods come in portions. (that way, I don&#039;t eat the whole thing in one sitting... ;) ). Love this idea, and as I have a carton of lovely groundcherries from my CSA sitting on my counter, I&#039;ll be making some of these very soon! Thank you so much!!!</description>

		<description>I have enjoyed these for years (like, 40!). In Michigan my kids learned to ID the wild sort, differentiating them from the wild inedible species--of which, as was pointed out quite clearly in the caveat of the author/baker&#039;s text, there are many. I was concerned to read a couple of posters&#039; comments from last year that indicated they were planning to eat the ORANGE &quot;Japanese lanterns&quot; that are NOT edible--so I hope those folks are still out there somewhere, alive &amp; well...
ANYway: I have introduced friends to ground cherries over the years as wonderful little fruits that pick themselves when ripe, have no pest or disease problems in the garden (and grow ever so much larger &amp; tastier there when cultivated and coddled by good soil &amp; regular watering). It has been difficult to resist eating them just as they fall, but some years I have had enough garden space for more than a couple of plants (they are low-growing but definitely do like to sprawl, elbowing less energetic plants aside as they go!). Then I have made pies and also tried jam--thanks to a recipe in one of edible wild plant guru Euell Gibbons&#039; books--but found it much too sweet for my taste, even after fiddling with it and adding lime juice. May play with the recipe again this year as so far it looks as though I will have a very generous harvest of the little lovelies.
If anyone has a jam recipe for these, please post it!!
Oh--and Pinetree Seeds is one U.S. source for the seed; I think Nichols Garden Nursery also has them. Once grown, they will self-sow or a gardener can save the seed just as one would tomato seeds; propagation &amp; culture also is the same.
Maybe next year I&#039;ll grow extras &amp; take them to market here in central Ohio.
P.S.-- Vegan yumyum--your photos are mouth-wateringly wonderful and inspiring!</description>

		<description>I love ground cherries.  We grow them every year.  They come up automatically every year because what when the fruit is somewhat eaten by ants and you don&#039;t get all the cherries off the ground in the fall the plant comes up in the spring by themselves..  It&#039;s great to see them every year.   My mother makes double crust pie, custard pie and jam out of them.  At one time I found receipes for coffee cake but now I can&#039;t find anything like that.  I would appreciate any other ideas from people.</description>

		<description>I discovered these a couple of years ago on a trip to Montreal. I&#039;ve been going nuts trying to find a local source for them.  Clearly by the time I get to the Copley Place farmer&#039;s market, they&#039;re all gone!

I just ordered some seeds and I&#039;m going to try to grow them in my Aerogarden.  They&#039;re supposed to grow pretty much like cherry tomatoes.  Since they only grow up to 1 to 3 feet tall, they should be perfect.</description>
