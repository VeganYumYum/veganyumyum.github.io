		<description>This post is exactly what I needed - a food photography tutorial from a food blogger. Every other tutorial I&#039;ve read seem to be from professional photographers who expect people to invest in a whole photo studio basically. I bought myself a new Canon this summer and while my photos improved dramatically just with that, I now know I need to learn how to use the camera properly. Thanks!</description>
