<p>So basically, my crock pot hates me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supposed to be one of the easiest appliances to use, right?  Everytime I&#8217;ve tried to <em>something</em> has gone wrong.  Things are either over cooked or undercooked, and definitely not very tasty.  I decided I needed to find a recipe that couldn&#8217;t possibly fail.  When I realized I had 5 pounds of apples, I had my answer.</p>
<p>I found a recipe for crock pot apple butter, and it seemed super easy.  Peel and chop the apples, add sugar and spices, let cook overnight.  I could do that.  My crock pot could do that.</p>
<p>It turns out peeling and chopping 5 1/2 pounds of apples is kind of a pain in the a&#8230;pple.  Your hands get all slippery and tired, and you get sticky apple juice everywhere.  Then the apples didn&#8217;t fit into my crockpot, so I had to puree them all in order to make the most of the space I had.  Finally I got everything in the crock pot and turned it on.  The recipe said the whole thing would take less than 12 hours.  Great!</p>
<p>12 hours later?  Not even close to done.</p>
<p>I ended up cooking this apple butter for a full 24 hours.  Between prepping, cooking, and canning, the whole project took 26 hours!  26!  A lot of that was downtime, but still.  My crock pot is cursed.</p>
<p>It was so worth it though.  It&#8217;s dark, sweet, tangy, silky, and spicy.  It is SO GOOD on toast with a little vegan margarine, you have no idea.  It&#8217;s like concentrated apple pie.  I wish you could taste it.  Well, actually, you might be able to!</p>
<p>Since I have a lot of this stuff, and it&#8217;s such a b&#8230;anana to make, I&#8217;m going to give away three jars to VeganYumYum readers.  Yay!</p>
<p><strong>Win Homemade Organic Apple Butter!</strong></p>

<p><a title="Homemade Apple Butter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3003818502/"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/3003818502_9276190fdc_m.jpg" alt="Homemade Apple Butter" width="160" height="240" /></a>1)  Comment!<br />
2)  Use a valid email address! (Will not be published!)<br />
3)  Win apple butter!</p>
<p>In one week (November 11th at 5 PM), I&#8217;ll use a random number generator to pick three numbers, corresponding to the comments here.  Those people win a 1/2 pint jar of organic apple butter, complete with fun spreader knife and recipe card.  I&#8217;ll email you to tell you you&#8217;ve won: just reply with a mailing address.</p>
<p><strong>Some general rules:</strong> If you don&#8217;t leave a valid email address with your comment, I&#8217;ll pick another person.  If I don&#8217;t hear back from you with your mailing address, I&#8217;ll pick another person.  I&#8217;ll ship overseas, so don&#8217;t worry, everyone can play!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t win, here&#8217;s the recipe.  I used <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Crock-Pot-Apple-Butter-93886">this recipe found I online</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Crock Pot Apple Butter</strong><br />
<em>Makes 4 Pints</em></p>
<p>5 1/2 lbs Apples, peeled and finely chopped (as many different kinds as you can!)<br />
4 Cups Sugar<br />
2-3 tsp Cinnamon<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cloves<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 Sprinkle Nutmeg</p>
<p>Peel and core the apples.  Slice finely or puree in a food processor.  Add apples and remaining ingredients to your crock pot.  Cook on high for 1 hour, then on low for 8-10 hours.  Remove lid (or crack it open a bit) and cook on high until a wooden spoon stands upright in it.  The apple butter will have reduced by about half to get to this point.  Blend if desired.</p>
<p>Fill sterilized jars with simmering apple butter and process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath.  Remove jars and let sit, undisturbed, overnight.  Test the seals and refrigerate any jars that have not sealed completely.  Fully sealed jars will keep for 18-24 months unopened.  Once opened, the apple butter will keep for 2 months in the refrigerator, or indefinitely in the freezer.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2371260911/" title="Tangelo Marmalade by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2149/2371260911_40d0da7667.jpg" alt="Tangelo Marmalade" height="500" width="390" /></a></p>
<p>I bought some organic <a href="http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/CH072">Minneola Tangelos</a> last time I went to the store.  When I juiced one, I was shocked. It was practically a water balloon.  I couldn&#8217;t believe how much juice came out of each one.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmalade">marmalade</a> for a while now, and here was a perfect opportunity to make it.</p>
<p>My mother loves marmalade, so there was always a jar in the fridge for toast or PB&amp;J sandwiches when I was growing up.  I loved the rich orange color, I loved the little wisps of rind, and I loved the &#8220;adult&#8221; flavor&#8211;sweet and bitter at the same time.</p>
<p>I made just a small amount of marmalade because I didn&#8217;t feel like going through the effort of canning, and besides, I only had three tangelos left.  One jar of marmalade would be perfect.  In retrospect, this stuff is so damn good I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t buy out the store&#8217;s entire supply of tangelos to put up as much of it as possible.  But I suppose there&#8217;s still time for that!</p>
<p>I think my absolute favorite way to eat marmalade is on toast with a little Earth Balance margarine to balance the sweetness.  I&#8217;m not generally a toast and jam sort of girl, but I make an exception for marmalade.  If you only enjoy your marmalade on toast, though, you&#8217;re really missing out.  It makes an excellent glaze for tofu, seitan, or veggies.  It&#8217;s perfect in between layers of cake.  Mix it in with ice cream, make a dipping sauce for pot stickers&#8230; you get the idea.  It works equally well for sweet and savory dishes.</p>
<p>You can use any citrus you want for this, including lemons.  Traditionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange">Seville Oranges</a> are used, but I really enjoy this version made with minneola tangelos&#8211;they&#8217;re a cross between a tangerine (super sweet) and a grapefruit (deliciously tart) and have tons of juice.  Use whatever citrus that&#8217;s in season and organic (no nasty chemicals on the rinds) and you&#8217;ll have a wonderful result.  Here&#8217;s the formula:</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>For every 1 lb fruit (weighed after zest and rind are removed)</strong><br />
3 Cups Water<br />
2 Cups Sugar<br />
50% Available Zest</p>
<p>Makes approx. 16oz Marmalade</p>
<p><strong>Additonal Add-Ins:</strong> A cinnamon stick, some thinly sliced ginger, hot chilies, star anise.</p></blockquote>
<p>I used three tangelos which was about 1/2 lb peeled fruit, so my measurements were 1 1/2 cups water, 1 cup sugar, and 50% of the zest.  That produced approximately 8 oz of finished marmalade.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2371713274/" title="Tangelo Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2371713274_686cd6d63b.jpg" alt="Tangelo Zest" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Wash your fruit well and use a regular vegetable peeler to remove the zest.  Take the zest off in wide strips, 1-2&#8243; long.  Discard 50% of the zest, leaving only the pieces that are in the best condition (no discoloration, etc).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2370880823/" title="Zest Julienne by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2349/2370880823_e153187cd2.jpg" alt="Zest Julienne" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Chop the zest.  I prefer to julienne it (it&#8217;s just so gosh darn pretty that way), but any kind of small cut will do just fine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2371723958/" title="Cooked Tangelo Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2371723958_4af5aeccd7.jpg" alt="Cooked Tangelo Zest" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Boil the zest in water for 10 minutes, then strain.  Boil again in fresh water until tender.  I boiled mine for about 10 minutes after the rinse, but the time to tenderness will depend on how you cut your zest.  Strain and set aside once tender.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2370885113/" title="Adding Water by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2210/2370885113_2dddbfdbaa.jpg" alt="Adding Water" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, chop up your fruit.  You can remove the white pith if desired.  I left mine on because I was lazy.  If you leave yours on, too, remember that this will add to the weight.  I wanted to use about 1/2 pound of fruit, so I measured a little heavy (11 oz. as opposed to 8 oz.) to account for the added weight of the peel.</p>
<p>Add fruit and water to a large sauce pot (you&#8217;ll need a lot of room in there, once the sugar starts to boil the volume will increase considerably).  Boil the fruit and water for 15-20 minutes.  You can use a potato masher to crush the fruit a bit if desired.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2371728366/" title="Straining Juice by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2241/2371728366_1ed2622d19.jpg" alt="Straining Juice" height="500" width="333" /></a></p>
<p>Let the fruit/water mixture sit until it&#8217;s cool enough to handle, then strain out the juice.  Since I was making a small amount of marmalade, I only had 1 cup of juice after straining.</p>
<p>Add the juice, the zest and the sugar back to the pot.  Boil for 15-20 minutes until a small amount of the the marmalade &#8220;sets-up&#8221; on a cold spoon or dish.  The longer the marmalade cools, the thicker it will get.  (Don&#8217;t worry if your marmalade doesn&#8217;t set up super-firm, it&#8217;s still tasty and will make a great glaze.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2371731796/" title="Tangelo Marmalade by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2096/2371731796_306e58479c.jpg" alt="Tangelo Marmalade" height="500" width="333" /></a></p>
<p>Turn off the heat and let the marmalade sit for 20 minutes or so.  Then pour it into jars.  If you wish to preserve/can the marmalade, now is when you&#8217;d process it in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/423361618/">Boiling Water Bath</a>.  Without a BW bath, the marmalade <em>must</em> be refrigerated and consumed within several days.  For canning instructions, follow the directions included with your canning jars.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, in a few days I&#8217;ll post a recipe for Grilled Marmalade Tofu.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the second <a href="http://www.theppk.com/">PPK</a> potluck, and this time the theme is orange &#8211; flavor or color.  I decided to make mini samosas with mango chutney.  If a little chutney is good, certainly a lot of chutney is better.  I&#8217;ve been reading up on home canning recently and decided a high-acid food like mango chutney would be a great introduction to preserving food.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/423361640/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/157/423361640_a994c6554d_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Home Canning Casualty" height="160" width="240" /></a>I now have 8 half-pint jars of homemade chutney ready to go, but I fear the samosas will need to be prepared by my husband Stewart.  When canning, you should really use the proper equipment.  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=jar%20lifters&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Jar lifters</a> are indispensable.  I decided that tongs and a <a href="http://www.surlatable.com/product/silicone+mini+oven+mitts.do?search=basic&keyword=silicone&sortby=shortdesc&asc=true&page=all">oven mit</a> would be <em>just fine</em> until I got a jar lifter.  Oh, how wrong I was!  The jar slipped from the tongs and splashed boiling water inside my heat-proof water-proof mit, burning me thoroughly.  If you&#8217;re going to try home canning, please spend the $5 for a jar lifter.  Please.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/423361618/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/423361618_d72e79589d_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Mango Chutney in Boiling Water Bath" height="240" width="160" /></a>Despite the whole painful injury thing, home canning is fun.  I&#8217;ll post a full write up on it once I&#8217;m able to complete the process with properly fuctioning limbs.  The photo to the left shows my chutney processing in a <em>boiling water bath</em>, which does double duty killing any unwatned bacteria and forming a vacuum seal.  Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be able to check to make sure my seals are tight, but until then they sit undisturbed in the kitchen.</p>
<p>This chutney, as long as the seals test okay, will keep for at least a year.  How exciting!  I can&#8217;t wait to try more home caning (after my hand heals, of course.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I&#8217;ll have a full update on the Boston Orange themed potluck, pictures and all.  I hear there will be cake and pies galore, root beer floats and even orange pizza.  I&#8217;m very excited.  If my hand is up to it, I might even make some donuts.</p>
