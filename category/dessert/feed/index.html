<p>Kuchen means cake in German.  There are as many different kinds of kuchen as there are kinds of cake.</p>
<p>I saw this recipe for upside-down plum kuchen in the latest issue of Gourmet Magazine, and I just had veganize it.  I&#8217;m glad I did, because the cake base of this kuchen might now be my favorite coffee cake base ever.  It&#8217;s light and fluffy, and like my <a href="../../../2009/07/slow-rise-pancakes/index.html">Slow Rise Pancakes</a>, it uses yeast instead of baking powder or baking soda for leavening.  I really love the clean, rich flavor of yeast-raised goods, so when I looked at this particular recipe I knew I had to make an animal-friendly version.</p>
<p>They used plums in the Gourmet version, so when I found tiny, sweet organic plums at the Copley Farmers Market here in Boston, it was kismet.  However, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d recommend you use plums in yours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927629/" title="Organic Plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3769927629_e7f25529d8.jpg" width="450" alt="Organic Plums" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  The plums themselves are very sweet, but I noticed a mild bitterness in the skins, even when I ate them fresh.  After baking, the bitterness intensified.  It&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing, it&#8217;s similar to the bitterness of marmalade.  If you really love the combination of sweet and bitter in a fruit, then go for the plums.  If you&#8217;re not sure, choose another stone fruit; peaches or cherries would be completely divine in this.  On second thought, I think nearly any bake-able fruit would be great.</p>
<p>Because this is a yeast-risen cake, it does take a while.  Two hours for the first rise and ninety minutes for the second rise means this isn&#8217;t a fast dessert.  If you&#8217;re looking for a quick coffee cake, try this <A href="../../../2008/06/crumb-cake/index.html">crumb cake</a> instead.  But the flavor and texture of this kuchen really make all the time worthwhile. </p>
<p><strong>Plum Kuchen <em>(adapted from Gourmet Magazine, Aug 2009)</em></strong><br />
<em>Makes One 9&#215;9 Cake</em></p>
<p>1 Packet Active-Dry Yeast (2 1/4 tsp)<br />
1/4 Cup Warm Water (105-110ยบ F)<br />
2 Cups plus 2 Tbs All-Purpose Flour, divided<br />
1 Cup Sugar, divided<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/2 Cup plus 1 Tbs Tofutti Sour Cream (or plain vegan yogurt)<br />
2 tsp Ener-G Egg Replacer Powder mixed with 3 Tbs Hot Water<br />
1 1/2 tsp Fresh Lemon Zest<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbs Earth Balance Margarine, divided<br />
3/4 lbs Firm-Ripe Plums or other Stone Fruit, halved and pitted</p>
<p>Combine the yeast with the warm water and set aside to proof until foamy.</p>
<p>In a mixing bowl (one that fits in a stand mixer, if you have one), combine the yeast with 2 cups flour, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, sour cream, egg replacer, lemon zest, and vanilla extract.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927547/" title="Lemon Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2431/3769927547_9d17db82c5.jpg" width="450" alt="Lemon Zest" /></a></p>
<p>Beat at low speed to combine the ingredients, then mix at medium speed for 5 minutes while adding in 1/2 cup of Earth Balance, one tablespoon at a time.  Beat the batter for five minutes at medium speed until smooth and shiny, and very sticky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927595/" title="Batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2467/3769927595_dbb867d85c.jpg" width="450" alt="Batter" /></a></p>
<p>After five minutes, remove the bowl from the mixer and top with the remaining 2 Tbs of flour.  Do not mix it in.  Cover the bowl with a non-terry cloth kitchen towel and set aside to rise for 90 minutes to 2 hours.</p>
<p>After the first rise, mix the the dough to combine the flour on the top.</p>
<p>With the remaining 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance, grease a 9&#215;9 cake pan.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>Halve and pit the plums.  It may be easier to cut around the pits, rather than to pull them out, if your fruit is very ripe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727894/" title="Organic Plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3558/3770727894_e8ec8860ca.jpg" width="450" alt="Organic Plums" /></a></p>
<p>Slice the pitted plum halves into five or six slices.  I left mine whole because they were very small. Place cut-side down into the sugar, covering the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927733/" title="Plum Kuchen, plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/3769927733_8552d6438e.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen, plums" /></a></p>
<p>Pour the dough over the plums and let raise for another 90 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727964/" title="Plum Kuchen, batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3428/3770727964_56bf5b37d1.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen, batter" /></a></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375ยบ F.</p>
<p>Bake the kuchen for 35 minutes, until evenly golden and slightly cracked.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727998/" title="Plum Kuchen by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/3770727998_bbf98632fb.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen" /></a></p>
<p>Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes.  Loosen edges with a knife and turn out onto a rack to cool completely before serving.</p>

<p>I adore this recipe. </p>
<p>When I went vegan a little over five years ago, I had a minor panic attack when I realized I&#8217;d never eat another Cinnabon again.  I remember I used to ask my dad to bring them home from the airport for me when I was little, whenever he had a business trip.  The fluffy swirls of dough, the sugary syrup, the cream cheese frosting&#8230; I needed to recreate them perfectly, vegan style.  And let me tell you, these are a dead ringer for our mall and airport favorites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759744/" title="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3611/3511759744_850ede165d_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting" /></a>But it comes at a price.  If you&#8217;re looking for a healthy, low-fat, calorie conscious treat, I can&#8217;t help you today.  If you&#8217;re looking for a recipe that is guaranteed to win over any vegan doubter, guaranteed to please any Cinnabon lover, guaranteed to send any child into a permanent sugar high; these buns are for you.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of sugar and Earth Balance margarine in these.  But hey, the recipe makes a ton of rolls, and it takes four hours to make, so they&#8217;re really special occasion buns.  Embrace the cups (and cups) of sugar and fat, and you will definitely be rewarded with the most perfect cinnamon bun you&#8217;ve ever had.  Isn&#8217;t it worth it, at least once?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t yet overcome your apprehension about yeast breads, I encourage you to give these a try.  I&#8217;ve included tons of photos <em>and</em> a video to clarify the process and give you an idea how the dough is supposed to look at every step.  They might seem intimidating, but they&#8217;re easier than you think!  </p>
<p>I think these would be an amazing way to wake up Mom on Sunday, paired with a nice hot cup of coffee.  You can make these ahead of time, refrigerating over night before the second rise and popping them in the oven in the morning, or you can freeze them for later.  More info on that at the end of the recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Cinnamon Buns</strong><br />
<em>Makes 12 Large Buns</em></p>
<p><em>Yeast Mixture</em><br />
4 tsp Active Dry Yeast (a little less than 2 packets)<br />
1 tsp Sugar<br />
1 Cup Water, 110ยบ F</p>
<p><em>Dough</em><br />
1 Cup Soymilk<br />
2/3 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
2 Ener-g Egg Replacer Eggs, prepared, optional<br />
Yeast Mixture, from above<br />
6 Cups All Purpose Flour, more for kneading</p>
<p><em>Dough Filling</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1 1/2 Cups Sugar<br />
3 Tbs Cinnamon</p>
<p><em>Pan Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1/3 Cup Sugar</p>
<p><em>Cream Cheese Frosting </em><br />
1/4 Cup Earth Balance<br />
1/3 Cup Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 Cup Powdered Sugar</p>
<p>Combine yeast mixture and set aside to proof.</p>
<p>From the dough ingredients, combine the soymilk, sugar, earth balance, salt, and ener-g eggs in a small sauce pan.  Heat until earth balance is melted and all the ingredients are well combined, but do not let the mixture get too hot.  You should be able to put a finger in it without burning yourself.</p>
<p>The yeast should now be nice and foamy (proofed).  Combine it with the warmed liquid you just made; make sure it&#8217;s not too hot, or you will kill your yeast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759002/" title="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3511759002_8da80553b5.jpg" width="450" alt="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients" /></a></p>
<p>Place 4 cups of all purpose flour in a large bowl.  Add the warmed wet ingredients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947095/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3510947095_18541808d4.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Beat the batter well with a wooden spoon.  The dough will be very wet and liquid, much more like a batter than a dough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947133/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3510947133_6f1c0e20c9.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Add 2 more cups of flour and mix in partially.  It&#8217;ll look like a wreck.  That&#8217;s fine!  Turn out the dough onto a large table/kneading surface, scraping out everything in the bowl.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759156/" title="Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3511759156_55f79e8e1b.jpg" width="450" alt="Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Begin kneading, gently at first.  It&#8217;s going to take about 8 minutes to get the dough where it needs to be.  Add more flour only if the dough starts sticking to the table and there is no more dry flour to be worked into the dough.  You want the dough to end up smooth and elastic, and slightly tacky, but not sticky.  You should be able to knead it on a bare table without it sticking.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the kneading and cutting process, so you can see the stages the dough goes through.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/4550120">Cinnamon Buns</a></p>
<p>Once the dough is ready, place it in an oiled bowl, covered with oiled plastic wrap, to rise for 90 minutes in a warm spot.  If you&#8217;re lacking a warm spot, turn your oven on low for 1 minute, then turn it off and place the dough in the oven to rise with the door closed.  Remember to turn the oven off after one minute, and remember the dough is in there &#8212; no preheating for other things! (I&#8217;ve made that mistake more than once, it&#8217;s never good.)</p>
<p>Once the dough has risen completely, it&#8217;ll leave a little dent when you poke it.  If it springs back, it needs more time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947303/" title="Risen Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3510947303_c2fc90c201.jpg" width="450" alt="Risen Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and press it down (this is part is in the video above).  You want it press or roll it out into a 15 x 20 inch rectangle.  You can use a roller if you want, but it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Pour the 1/2 cup of melted earth balance on the dough.  Brush it so the dough is covered completely.  It&#8217;s okay if it pools in some locations.</p>
<p>Mix together the cinnamon and sugar from the dough filling above.  Sprinkle it evenly over the dough. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947379/" title="Cinnamon Sugar Filling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/3510947379_2db606b531.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Sugar Filling" /></a></p>
<p>Prepare a large baking dish, like a lasagna dish, by pouring in the melted earth balance from the pan sauce ingredients above.  Brush the sides of the pan so they are greased.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947207/" title="Melted Earth Balance by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3510947207_9f6a344cb8.jpg" width="450" alt="Melted Earth Balance" /></a></p>
<p>Add the sugar, spreading evenly over the bottom of pan.  The pan is now ready for the buns.</p>
<p>The following steps are shown in detail in the video above:  Roll the dough up gently, starting from one of the short sides.  Let it rest on the seem once it&#8217;s rolled up completely.  Cut 12 rolls with dental floss or sewing thread.  Place the rolls in the pan.  (Ignore the fact that they are practically floating in earth balance and sugar.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947437/" title="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3510947437_0f43140f93.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked" /></a></p>
<p>Cover the buns and let rise for 45 minutes if you will be baking these immediately.  If baking the next day, cover the buns and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.  Bake in the morning with no need for more rising.  If making the buns for a date in the future, cover the buns and freeze immediately.  The day before you are ready to use them, defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then let warm up on the counter the next morning for an hour.  In any case, when ready to bake, follow the directions below.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350ยบ F, remembering to remove the rising buns if they are in there!</p>
<p>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.  Let cool for a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947489/" title="Cinnamon Buns, baked by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3510947489_405363645e.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Buns, baked" /></a></p>
<p>Stir together the frosting ingredients.  It takes a bit of elbow grease to mix it together, but resist the urge to add liquid.  It will come together, I promise.  Whisk until there are no lumps.</p>
<p>Serve the buns warm with frosting.  I like to microwave completely cooled buns for 45-60 seconds before eating.</p>
<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>I always have trouble finding vegan graham crackers at the store.  Nearly every single brand has honey in them.  The one version that doesn&#8217;t is full of icky ingredients.  </p>
<p>When I got my <a href="http://www.dandiescandies.com/">Dandies</a> in the mail, I knew I had to make my own graham crackers once and for all.  The recipe turned out really good.  I&#8217;d like to perfect the texture a little (ideally, I&#8217;d actually like them to be <i>more</i> crumbly than they are), but the flavor is nice and mellow, and it really highlights the sweet, nutty taste of whole wheat without being overly sugary.  If you like your graham crackers really sweet, add a bit more sugar than I call for.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3445457388/" title="Graham Crackers by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3445457388_8e650daf93_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Graham Crackers" /></a>Graham crackers are traditionally made with graham flour, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Graham">Sylvester Graham</a>, a really interesting (if slightly crazy) health nut from the 19th century.  He promoted the vegetarian diet (yay!) to cure, among other things, sexual desires (I did say he was slightly crazy).</p>
<p>Graham flour is whole wheat flour.  What makes it different from standard whole wheat is the ratio of endosperm to bran to germ.  Sylvester Graham ground these parts of the wheat berry separately to preserve texture and then re-combined them in a specific proportion.  You can find graham flour in some stores and online, or you can make your own.  Wikipedia says &#8220;one cup of graham flour is approximately equivalent to 84 g (~2/3 cup) white flour, 15 g (slightly less than 1/3 cup) wheat bran, and 2.5 g (1.5 teaspoons) wheat germ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you can do what I did and just use stoneground flour and call it a day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3445457040/" title="Stoneground Whole Wheat Flour by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3445457040_8fe50d8bf5_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Stoneground Whole Wheat Flour" /></a>Actually, you can use whatever flour you like for these.  I used stoneground flour because it has little flecks of bran in it, which adds some lovely texture to the crackers.  I really recommend using at least some form of whole wheat, because it gives the graham crackers their traditional nutty flavor.  Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s healthier.  And rest assured it won&#8217;t mess with your libido.  Sorry Sylvester. </p>
<p>Graham crackers are tasty, but they aren&#8217;t the sexiest food in the world.  S&#8217;mores, on the other hand?  Sexy.  I made these with Chicago Soydairy&#8217;s latest vegan treat, <A href="http://www.dandiescandies.com/">Dandies vegan marshmallows</a>.  They are awesome!  It&#8217;s my understanding that they&#8217;re being sold online, but sell out FAST. So if you see them available, scoop them up!  They taste great, and they&#8217;re gelatin free, and they roast up just like the non-vegan version.  Perfect for s&#8217;mores.</p>
<p>How about a little video before the recipe?  Don&#8217;t forget all my videos are HD, so you can watch them full-screen!</p>

<p><strong>Graham Crackers</strong><br />
<em>Makes at least 24 3&#215;3&#8243; Crackers</em></p>
<p>2 1/2 Cups Graham Flour or Stoneground Flour or Whole Wheat Flour<br />
1 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
1/2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp Cinnamon<br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/4 Cup Dark Brown Sugar<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1/4 Cup Agave Nectar (or a little more sugar mixed with water)<br />
3/4 Cup Water</p>
<p>Mix the all the dry ingredients together.  Cream together Earth Balance and sugar.  Add vanilla and agave and beat with a whisk until smooth.  Add a little of the flour and a little of the water to the earth balance/sugar mixture and combine.  Continue adding in flour and water, a little at a time, until all flour and water is added.  Work the dough with your hands until everything is evenly combined.</p>
<p>Divide dough in half and cover.  Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  </p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325ยบ F.  Roll out the dough into a rectangle that measures approximately 11&#8243;x15&#8243;.  Trim edges.  Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into squares or rectangles (I cut mine into 3&#8242;x3&#8242; squares).  Prick the squares with a fork.</p>
<p>Bake for 30-40 minutes at 325ยบ F or until the crackers are turning golden brown around the edges.  You can sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top of the crackers during the last 10 minutes of baking if you like.</p>
<p>Remove from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack.  See the video above for visual directions.</p>
<p><strong>For S&#8217;mores</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3444639257/" title="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3444639257_afe856a259.jpg" width="450" alt="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies" /></a></p>
<p>Place the crackers in multiples of two on a baking sheet and preheat the oven to broil.  Add chocolate to one cracker and vegan marshmallows to another until all the crackers are topped.  Broil for less than 1 minute, watching constantly, until the marshmallows are golden and melty and the chocolate has softened. </p>

<p>Remove from oven, assemble the s&#8217;more, and eat!  The graham crackers are also great plain, or topped with cream cheese frosting. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3416120866/" title="Apple Pie Coffee Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3416120866_0b922034de.jpg" width="450" alt="Apple Pie Coffee Cake" /></a></p>
<p>I have a knack for inventing things that have already been invented.  I made my husband an apple pie for his birthday, and was reminded how annoying it is to peel, core, and chop a lot of apples.  But I really like pies made with fresh fruit, so it&#8217;s not a process I&#8217;m planning on giving up anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3415313233/" title="Apple Pie Coffee Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3415313233_2d28515d15_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Apple Pie Coffee Cake" /></a>I went ahead and bought a jar of apple pie filling anyway, just in case I wanted to make a quicker pie with it, or do something else.  I thought it might be really brilliant to use the filling in a coffee cake, and hey!  It turns out there are lots of other brilliant people out there who have thought the same exact thing.</p>
<p>But my coffee cake is vegan, so <em>nanner nanner boo boo</em>!  It&#8217;s also really quick and easy to put together, so it&#8217;s perfect for that lazy Sunday morning-turned-afternoon baking project.</p>
<p>Let this cake cool for a bit before cutting and you&#8217;ll be surprised how easy it is to serve; the cake holds up really well and doesn&#8217;t fall apart when slicing.  It would be really nice served with a little scoop of vegan ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Pie Coffee Cake</strong><br />
<em>Makes 1 Cake</em></p>
<p>2 1/2 Cups Flour<br />
1 Cup Granulated Sugar<br />
1 tsp Baking Powder<br />
3/4 tsp Salt*<br />
1/2 tsp Cinnamon<br />
2/3 Cup Canola Oil, or 2/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, softened<br />
2/3 Cup Soymilk + 2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar (or lemon juice)<br />
2 Tbs Cornstarch mixed with 1/2 Cup Water<br />
2 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 20 to 25 oz Jar Apple Pie Filling<br />
1 Tbs Sugar mixed with 1 tsp Cinnamon, for topping.</p>
<p>*Reduce salt to 1/2 tsp if using Earth Balance.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350ยบ F.</p>
<p>Combine all the dry ingredients of the cake and mix well.  Add all of the liquid ingredients and fold the batter until just combined.  The batter should be thick and nearly dough-like, as this will prevent the filling from sinking to the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>Spread 1/2 of the batter in the bottom of a 9&#215;11&#8243; (or whatever) greased baking dish.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3415312835/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3415312835_c27054f7cb.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add apple pie filling evenly over the top.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3415312905/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3415312905_cc1692691f.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Spoon the rest of the batter over the top in clumps, leaving some of the apple filling showing through.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3416120534/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3376/3416120534_f357072119.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3416120598/" title="Cinnamon Sugar Topping by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3361/3416120598_6e0f00c8d8.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Sugar Topping" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 80 to 90 minutes or until a tester comes out clean.  Be sure not to under bake.  You may wish to cover the coffee cake with aluminum foil for the last 20-30 minutes to prevent over-browning.</p>
<p>Remove coffee cake from oven and let cool before serving.  It&#8217;s just as good or better the next day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000930/" title="Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3329000930_fdecdd4135_o.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>I first encountered daifuku at one of my favorite restaurants in Western Massachusetts, <A href="http://freshsideamherst.com/">Fresh Side</a>.  In their deli case were these cute little white and green pillow-looking desserts, sitting behind a hand-written card that said: Mochi (vegan).</p>
<p>I ordered one and when I bit into it, it was such a surprise.  First, the texture!  It&#8217;s like a dense marshmallow, chewy and soft.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  Next, the filling.  Beans.  Beans?  Beans.  This particular mochi was fillied with a sweetened red bean paste, also called anko, and I think it was the first time I had ever had sweet beans.  And it was really good!</p>
<p>Now, if I understand correctly, mochi is a catch-all term for a sweet dessert made with glutenous rice flour dough.  It can be baked, wrapped around ice cream, eaten plain, or filled.  Filled mochi, like the ones I&#8217;m blogging about today, are called daifuku.  </p>
<p>Anko is one of the most common fillings, but many people also use berries.  Strawberry filled ones are very popular in the spring, and they&#8217;re called ichigo daifuku.  Whole raspberries also work, and sometimes people include a white sweetened bean paste (as opposed to red) known as shiroan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000898/" title="Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3329000898_e70bc58f88.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Now what if I told you that I made these in the microwave?</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>I was skeptical, too.  The microwave in my house is pretty much reserved for reheating leftovers.  When I decided to make these, I was sort of shocked that all the recipes online called for nuking the dough.  What&#8217;s more, they were pretty unclear about how to tell when you&#8217;re dough is ready.  Microwaves seem to vary so much in power, 3 minutes in one microwave is very different than 3 minutes in another.  But I decided to give it a go, and not only did it work, but it was really, really easy.  If you are able to find pre-made red bean paste, you can make this whole recipe with only a microwave and just a few minutes. </p>
<p>So not only do you not need a kitchen for these (hello dorm-living vegans!), they&#8217;re also gluten free (hi celiacs!), soy free (hi soy&#8230;allergic lovelies!), fast (hi lazy people!), customizable (hi picky people!), and did I mention CUTE?  Traditional colors are white, green, and pink, but food coloring isn&#8217;t required if it grosses you out.  Matcha (green tea powder) is a natural and delicious flavoring that makes the mochi green.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165909/" title="Mochiko by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3328165909_4159851a76_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Mochiko" /></a>Now the one thing you absolutely need, no substitutions, is mochiko.  It&#8217;s glutenous rice flour, and no other flour will work for this.  You can find it easily at any asian market.</p>
<p>Also make sure you have some cornstarch or potato starch handy, the dough is very sticky!</p>
<p><strong>Daifuku</strong><br />
<em>Makes 10-12 Filled Cakes</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Mochiko<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Water<br />
2-3 Drops red or green food coloring, optional<br />
Cornstarch or Potato Starch, for dusting</p>
<p><em>Filling Ideas</em><br />
Anko (store bought or recipe below)<br />
Strawberries<br />
Raspberries</p>
<p><strong>Anko</strong><br />
<em>Makes enough for 3-4 batches of daifuku</em></p>
<p>1 14 oz Can Adzuki Beans<br />
1/2 Cup Water<br />
1 Cup Sugar<br />
1 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
1-2 Pinches Salt</p>
<p>Heat water and sugar separately until boiling and sugar is dissolved, turn off heat.  Drain and rinse beans.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000762/" title="Adzuki Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3329000762_0332e4c645.jpg" width="450" alt="Adzuki Beans" /></a></p>
<p>Add to a pan and mash.  Add 1/3 cup of the simple syrup you just made, along with salt and vegetable oil, and mash over medium heat.  Beans will thicken and become slightly glossy.  Add more syrup if desired.  Turn out into a bowl and let cool.</p>
<p><em>Making the Mochi</em></p>
<p>Add the mochiko, sugar, water, and food coloring (if using) to a microwave safe bowl.  Stir well, making sure there are no lumps.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as best you can with a rubber spatula, otherwise they&#8217;ll get all gross when the dough is microwaved.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165939/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3317/3328165939_f2de866948.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Cover lightly with plastic wrap and mircowave for 2 minutes.  Remove bowl from the microwave and stir VERY well.  Dough will be much thicker, but there should still be some raw parts underneath.  I like to use a sturdy silicone spatula to mix the dough at this point.  Place the dough back in the microwave for 1 more minute.  </p>
<p>Open the door and peek&#8211;did the dough start sinking as soon as the door opened?  If so, the dough was inflating while cooking, which means it&#8217;s ready.  If not, microwave for 1 more minute and check again.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to microwave for more than 4 minutes total (2 minutes initial cooking, 2 more additional minutes after mixing).</p>
<p>One the dough deflates when you open the door, remove the dough from the microwave and scrape it out onto a cornstarch-coated cutting board.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165993/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3328165993_981b983f39.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Pat the hot dough (be careful! It&#8217;s hot!) with cornstarch and flatten it out a little.  Cut into 10-12 even pieces.  Add 1 tsp of filling to each piece and gently press the edges together to seal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000858/" title="Making Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3542/3329000858_0f09123ef8.jpg" width="450" alt="Making Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the whole process in a little HD video for you to watch!  No sound, so don&#8217;t worry about turning down the volume if you&#8217;re at work. The video starts right after I took the dough out of the mircowave and dumped it onto the cutting board.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/3473920">Making Daifuku</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to keep these fresh is to individually wrap them in plastic wrap and then refrigerate.  If you leave them out, unwrapped, they&#8217;ll get dry and tough.  Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671457/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1187/3266671457_03448c94b6.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you that want to try out the candied clementines but maybe don&#8217;t want to eat them whole (yes, you can eat the peel!), I offer you this lovely clementine bundt cake.  It&#8217;s a more traditional dessert for sure, but I think more broadly appealing than the candied clementines.  </p>
<p>I blended up the candied clementines I had leftover from the last post, and it became this gorgeous, thick, marmalade-like spread.  I thought it would be absolutely perfect to flavor a bundt cake with, and I was right.  I think I prefer the cake to the clementines alone!</p>
<p>This cake was so perfectly moist and fluffy, I nearly teared up when I had the first bite.  It&#8217;s a wonderful combination of sweet, citrusy, and slightly bitter (in a good way) from the peel.  The clementine flavored poured fondant is really the ideal topping.  But don&#8217;t get scared off at the mention of poured fondant.  It&#8217;s super easy.  And it&#8217;s bakery quality icing.  You have to try it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671415/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3266671415_b4a043ea02_b.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a></p>
<p>You see, I like icing glazes, but it can be tricky to get the thickness right when you&#8217;re mixing powdered sugar with liquid.  Too thin and it just soaks into the cake a disappears, too thick and it doesn&#8217;t pour at all.  And there&#8217;s always that vague grainy mouth feel it leaves behind, thanks to the cornstarch in the powdered sugar.  I thought if I cooked it a little bit the powdered sugar would dissolve and help thicken the sugar (same idea for your basic stir-fry sauce thickened with cornstarch!).  But then I also remembered poured fondant.</p>
<p>I discovered poured fondant when I made <a href="../../../2008/01/petits-fours/index.html">petits fours</a>.  It&#8217;s a sugar-based icing that is heated until the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/video/softball.html">&#8220;soft ball&#8221;</a> stage, or 235-240ยบ F.  If you have a candy thermometer handy, use it, but it&#8217;s NOT necessary.  Since we&#8217;re only making a small amount of icing, I can pretty much guarantee you that boiling the icing for 10-20 seconds will bring you to the soft ball stage.  Easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671247/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3313/3266671247_0eff6039d1_m.jpg" width="163" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a>The cool part about fondant?  It sets, hard and glossy, when it cools.  So once you&#8217;ve heated it enough, you whisk it off the heat until it starts to thicken and pour it over your cake.  And like magic, it&#8217;ll harden and you&#8217;ll have totally perfect, totally professional-looking icing on your cake.  The icing in the photos?  Completely dry and set, even though it looks like it was just poured.  And if it cools too much before you&#8217;re ready to ice, just re-heat it to thin.</p>
<p>Plus, it tastes amazing because I use fresh clementine juice for the liquid as opposed to water.  Give it a try, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>Candied Clementine Cake</strong><br />
<em>Makes One Bundt Cake</em></p>
<p>1 1/2 Cup <a href="../../../2009/02/candied-clementines/index.html">Candied Clementine</a> Puree, around 5-8 clementines<br />
1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil<br />
1 1/4 Cup Soymilk, or other non-dairy milk<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
2 Cups All-Purpose Flour<br />
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
2 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
2 Fresh Clementines, for garnish</p>
<p><em>Clementine Poured Fondant</em><br />
1 1/4 Cup Confectioner&#8217;s Sugar<br />
3 Tbs Fresh Clementine Juice, or other citrus (about 3 clementines)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350ยบ F.</p>
<p>Puree the clementines in a food processor until fairly smooth, but small bits of peel are desirable in  my opinion! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266670991/" title="Candied Clementine Puree by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3266670991_99caf8b238.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Puree" /></a></p>
<p>Combine the clementine puree with the oil, soymilk, and sugar.  Whisk until smooth.</p>
<p>Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in another bowl.  </p>
<p>Grease a bundt pan with spray oil, vegan margarine like Earth Balance, or vegetable shortening.  Scoop a few spoonfuls of the dry mixture into the greased bundt pan and turn the pan to coat the sides and center spike.  Rap the pan against the counter to loosen any extra flour and pour it back into the dry mixture.</p>
<p>Fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture until combined.  Pour the batter into prepared bundt pan.  It&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s a little thick.</p>

<p>Bake at 350ยบ F for 45-50 minutes until a cake tester comes out clean.  Let cool upside-down on a large plate.  After a few minutes the cake <i>should</i> drop out of the pan onto the plate in one piece, assuming you didn&#8217;t miss any spots when greasing and dusting with flour.  Let cake cool completely before icing.</p>

<p><i>Clementine Poured Fondant</i></p>
<p>Whisk powdered sugar with 3 Tbs of clementine juice.  Add to a small sauce pan and bring to a rolling boil for 10-20 seconds, or until it reaches the soft-ball stage (235-240ยบ F).  </p>
<p>Remove from heat and whisk constantly until it starts to thicken.  At first, the icing will be a glossy yellow (similar to egg yolks), and it will gradually thicken and become lighter as it cools.  You want to pour it over the cake when it&#8217;s very clearly thickened, but not too cool (i.e. thick) to pour.  If the icing becomes too thick, simply reheat and start again.</p>
<p>Dust the cake with powdered sugar to finish, and garnish with fresh clementine segments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3253374943/" title="Candied Clementines by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3253374943_d88e1d83ae.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementines" /></a></p>
<p>When Valentine&#8217;s day rolls around, there are a lot of desserts to choose from.  There&#8217;s a lot of red, and a lot of hearts, and lots of strawberries.  In February. I&#8217;m not opposed to buying stuff out of season, but I decided to go with something a little different for a V-day dessert this year.</p>
<p>Clementines are in season, and they are totally yummy.  They&#8217;re small, easy to peel, sweet as sugar, and seedless.  You&#8217;d think that simmering them in simple syrup for a couple hours would be overkill, but in fact it actually tones down the sweetness, and brings out some of the bitterness of the peel.  The sugary sweet clementines become more complex, slightly bitter, but retain their bright citrus flavor.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not into candying the whole fruit, I ran across <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/candied-clementines">this recipe</a> online for candy-coating the segments.  They&#8217;d stand in very nicely for the whole fruit, and it doesn&#8217;t take as long.</p>
<p>These make a simple but decadent dessert, topped with crushed pistachios, shaved bittersweet chocolate, and served with a small demitasse cup of hot cocoa.  It&#8217;s the perfect treat for the darling clementine in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Candied Clementines</strong><br />
<em>Makes 12</em></p>
<p>12 Clementines, washed<br />
4 Cups Sugar<br />
3 Cups Water</p>
<p>Wash the clementines well.  Pierce them 8-10 times with a toothpick.  In a large, deep pot, combine clementines, sugar and water.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3254203274/" title="Clementines in Sugar by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/3254203274_4ed31927a5.jpg" width="450" alt="Clementines in Sugar" /></a></p>
<p>Bring to a simmer, covered, and simmer for 1-2 hours depending on the level of bitterness you&#8217;d like in your clementines.  Be careful to simmer, and not boil!  Let the clementines cool in the syrup.  (Save the simple syrup for additions to drinks and desserts.)</p>
<p>Serve clementines with crushed pistachios and shaved chocolate.</p>
<p>Before you ask, I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to store these.  I&#8217;d guess an airtight container, in the fridge to be safe.  I&#8217;d bring them to room temperature before serving.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Cocoa</strong><br />
<em>Small Portions For two</em></p>
<p>2 Tbs Dutch Pressed Cocoa Powder<br />
1 1/2 Tbs Sugar<br />
1 Cup Soymilk (or other non-dairy milk)</p>
<p>Combine cocoa and sugar in a small pot.  Add a dribble of soymilk and whisk to form a paste.  Add the rest of the soymilk and heat until steaming.  Serve in demitasse cups.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103472264/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/3103472264_e9725f2f58.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>This is a super cute dessert idea for winter-themed parties, and it isn&#8217;t much harder than making and frosting cupcakes.  If you have a sharp knife, some toothpicks, a piping bag and a star tip, you&#8217;re good to go.  It&#8217;s even more fun to make than it is to look at, or eat!</p>
<p>All I did was bake some cupcakes, cut them into cone shapes, stack them (secured with toothpicks) and then frosted them in such a way so that they looked like pine trees.  Powdered sugar adds a little snow.  At first I was bummed that my powdered sugar had so many HUGE lumps in it, until I realized they looked like little snow boulders.  Score!  You could get really creative and make little marzipan pine cones, or birds, or squirrels&#8230; you get the idea.  Why not make a sweet little forest for your friends and family to devour?</p>
<p>Oh man, I just realized I could have built an igloo out of sugar cubes.  Next time, I guess!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102642011/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/3102642011_b68a7c25a0.jpg" width="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>I used gel food coloring, both green and blue mixed together to get the shade right.  Using only green was too light and minty for what I was going for &#8211; so make sure you have some blue on hand to darken it up.  But there&#8217;s no reason your trees need to be green.  White trees would be stunning on a darker plate, or other non-standard colors like pink or brown to play up their cutesy, cartoony look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102638363/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/3102638363_962ea460c8.jpg" width="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Basic Sponge Cake</strong><br />
<em>Makes 15 cupcakes (a few extra for practicing)</em></p>
<p>1 1/3 Cups Soymilk mixed with 1 tsp Apple Cider vinegar<br />
2 Cups All Purpose Flour<br />
1 Cup Sugar<br />
2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1 Tbs Cornstarch<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 Cup Oil<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 tsp Almond Extract</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375ยบ F.</p>
<p>Mix soymilk and vinegar.  Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch and salt and mix well.  Add oil and extracts to soymilk mixture and whisk.  Add wet to dry and fold until just combined.  Fill each lined, sprayed cupcake mold with 1/4 cup batter.  Bake cupcakes at 375ยบ F for 20 minutes.  Remove from pans and let cool completely.</p>
<p><strong>Frosting</strong><br />
<em>Enough for 5-7 trees</em></p>
<p>1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/2 Cup Non-hydrogenated Shortening<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
About 3 Cups Powered Sugar, sifted, more if needed<br />
Food Coloring (green and blue for standard trees)</p>
<p>In a stand mixer, whip margarine and shortening until light and fluffy.  Whip in extract.  Slowly whip in powdered sugar until icing is fairly stiff.  Add coloring bit-by-bit until desired color is reached.  Transfer icing to a piping bag fitted it a small/standard sized star tip</p>
<p><strong>Creating the Trees</strong></p>
<p>Bake the cupcakes!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102629385/" title="Cupcakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3269/3102629385_7fb838b431.jpg" width="450" alt="Cupcakes" /></a></p>
<p>Unwrap the cupcakes and turn them upside-down.  With a knife, carve the cupcake into a cone.  If needed, flatten the base so the cupcake cone sits without wobbling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103461840/" title="Carving Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/3103461840_8ca49e01e6.jpg" width="450" alt="Carving Cake" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the cupcakes to make basic tree shapes.  Three high for tall trees, two high for short trees.  Secure with toothpicks.  You may want t make the base of your trees squatty so that they help the tree stand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103463022/" title="Basic Tree Shape by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/3103463022_b198d1bc29.jpg" width="450" alt="Basic Tree Shape" /></a></p>
<p>Create your forest!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102632765/" title="Cupcake Forest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/3102632765_32d785bc74.jpg" width="450" alt="Cupcake Forest" /></a></p>
<p>Begin icing your trees.  If you don&#8217;t have a revolving cake platter to ice on, use a small cutting board that you can easily turn as you work.  Start from the bottom and ice around and around up towards the top.  Use long-ish strokes that end in an upward sweep to create branches.  You can go back and fill in holes or weird spots later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102633979/" title="Icing Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3102633979_8e7c5a6835.jpg" width="450" alt="Icing Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Finish off with shorter, horizontal or upward pointing branches, and then one directly on top pointing straight up.  Take a look at your tree and add branches where needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102635913/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/3102635913_bc8181159b.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Use a spatula to gently and carefully transfer the trees to your serving plate.  Add lumps of powdered sugar if you have them, and anything else to finish up the forest scene.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar to add snow to the trees.</p>
<p>Happy winter!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079217168/" title="Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/3079217168_03ffb4e4a3.jpg" width="450"  alt="Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p>I love snickerdoodles.  Plain sugar cookies just don&#8217;t do it for me, but roll them in a little cinnamon-sugar and I&#8217;m sold.  (Roll nearly anything in cinnamon sugar and I&#8217;m sold.)</p>
<p>This is a cookie that preforms beautifully when veganized.  If you have a family recipe you use, I can almost guarantee you that all you need to do is sub Earth Balance Margarine for butter and Ener-g G Egg Replacer for eggs and you&#8217;ll be set.  Here is a recipe I made after checking out several different snickerdoodle recipes.  It&#8217;s fast, easy, and pretty near failproof.  In fact, stick some ribbon on them and you have an instant holiday gift!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079215842/" title="Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/3079215842_d6d8f79b94.jpg" width="450" alt="Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3078380887/" title="Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/3078380887_7d1a813189_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Snickerdoodles" /></a>One thing you should know, that I just found out today.  The temperature of the cookie dough as it goes in the oven determines the shape and overall look of the cookies.  If you want cookies that are pillowy and show a lot of cracks and texture, the dough needs to be pretty cold as it goes into the oven.  If you like thinner, more even-looking cookies, let the dough warm up a little before baking.</p>
<p>If the dough is cold, the cookies don&#8217;t have much time to warm up and flatten out before the outside of the cookie bakes and prevents further expansion.  If it&#8217;s already a little warm, the cookies will expand and spread (and flatten) in the first few minutes of cooking.  The pictures above are cookies baked when the dough was cold.  The photo to the left was made with warmer-dough.</p>
<p>These cookies are a snap if you make them in a stand-mixer, but only take slightly more elbow grease if you&#8217;re doing them by hand.  And they ship beautifully.  </p>
<p><strong>Snickerdoodles</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 18 Cookies</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Sugar<br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 Prepared Ener-g Egg-Replacer Egg<br />
1 1/2 Cups Flour<br />
1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar<br />
1/4 tsp Baking Soda</p>
<p>Cinnamon Sugar, for rolling</p>
<p>Cream sugar, Earth Balance, and vanilla extract together.  Prepare the Ener-G Egg by following the package instructions (1 1/2 tsp powder whisked with 2 Tbs hot water until foamy), and add it to the Earth Balance and sugar mixture.  Whip (or whisk) it all up until it&#8217;s light a fluffy, like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079207826/" title="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/3079207826_b9efd8b695.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar" /></a></p>
<p>Whisk the dry ingredients together.  Add 2/3 of the dry ingredients to the whipped mixture and whip until combined.  Add in the remaining flour and mix by hand.  Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375ยบ F.</p>
<p>When the dough is chilled, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Using a #40 ice cream scoop, make balls of dough (each ball will be made with 2 Tbs of dough, if you don&#8217;t have a #40 scoop).  Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079208288/" title="Making Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/3079208288_96b7631b30.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Making Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p>Now time to squish them!  Using a fork (or whatever you want), squish the dough out into cookie shapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079209646/" title="Making Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/3079209646_a057b4c4b4.jpg" width="450" alt="Making Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p>Bake at 375ยบ F for 10 minutes for chewy cookies, 12 minutes for crunchy.  Remove from oven and let sit for 30 seconds.  They&#8217;ll be very soft when they come out of the oven, but that&#8217;s just fine!  Gently remove cookies from the baking sheet and let cool for a few minutes on a wire rack before serving.</p>
<p>These are especially good with soy nog.  Just saying.</p>

<p>My idea for a Halloween post just wasn&#8217;t working out.  Good thing I have another holiday to cook for.</p>
<p>Happy Diwali!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali">Diwali</a> is a major Indian holiday, a festival of light.  There are lots of tasty dishes people make for Diwali, usually always vegetarian.  And like all holidays, there are all sorts of appropriate sweets and desserts you can make.  Here&#8217;s a really easy one, and you probably have all the ingredients you need already.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2981268969/" title="Kaju Katli by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3292/2981268969_eff8e879c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Kaju Katli" /></a>I got the idea for this from <a href="http://saffronhut.blogspot.com/2006/10/simple-sweet-kaju-kathli-cashew.html">Saffron Hut</a>, so the base recipe comes from there.  I added a pinch of salt to balance the sweet, as well as some cardamom because it&#8217;s not only delicious, but traditional.</p>
<p>Kaju Katli (cashew diamonds) is sort of a cross between marzipan and brittle.  It has the sweet, chewy-ness of marzipan with the rich, creamy taste of brittle.  A lot of times it&#8217;s decorated with some edible silver leaf, but I didn&#8217;t have any (nor do I have the faintest idea where to get some!).  Instead I used cardamom pods, some pretty colored sugar, and a nice anise star.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, quick, and delicious.  A perfect way to celebrate Diwali, or just try out a new sweet treat!</p>
<p><strong>Kaju Katli</strong><br />
<em>Makes 20-30 Diamonds</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Cashews, raw and unsalted<br />
4 Cardamom pods, seeds removed and crushed (optional)<br />
1 Pinch Salt<br />
3/4 Cup Sugar<br />
1/4 Cup Water</p>
<p>Grind the cashews into as fine a powder as you can.  You can try your coffee grinder; shake it or rap it against the counter to keep the cashews from gumming up the blade.  You can also try a blender, a food processor, or a mortar and pestle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2982125026/" title="Ground Cashews by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/2982125026_3c20c2b7cc.jpg" width="450" alt="Ground Cashews" /></a></p>
<p>Mix cardamom powder, salt, and cashews together.  Heat water and sugar in a pot until boiling.  Add cashews and stir well with a rubber spatula.  Cook for abut 5 minutes until the mixture thickens.  You can tell it&#8217;s ready when it a dribble of it on a cool plate forms a soft ball.</p>
<p>Pour out the mixture onto lightly oiled aluminum foil.  A lot of directions I read say you should let the mixture cool and then knead until glassy.  The rill out to 1/4&#8243; thick and slice into diamonds.  I cooked mine a little too long, so it set up firmer than it should have.  I just cut it after it cooled (instead of kneading it and rolling it out) and that worked fine, but I think the textured suffered a little. </p>
<p>Store in an airtight container in layers separated by parchment paper.</p>
<p>Have a great Diwali! </p>
