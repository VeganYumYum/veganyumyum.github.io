<p>This isn&#8217;t a traditional recipe. This is a quick and dirty (read: easy and yummy) version of a hot soup made with soba noodles topped with deep fried tofu.  Putting fried tofu on top of soba noodle soup makes it kitsune soba.  Kitsune means fox in Japanese, and folklore says fox spirits are quite fond of fried tofu, hence the name &#8220;fox soba.&#8221;  It&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>I like recipes that are flexible.  Once you have the broth, the noodles, and the tofu, you can add whatever else you want on top.  I chose to go light and easy, a few fresh pea shoots and thinly sliced raw carrots.  Then I topped everything off with Bull Dog Sauce.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;re not supposed to put Bull Dog Sauce on soba noodle soup.  But I did, and it was good, and no one yelled at me, so I&#8217;m pretty sure you can do it too if you want.  It&#8217;s sort of a like a Japanese steak sauce/bbq sauce.  There are many different variations, but I used the Fruit and Vegetable Semi-Sweet version.  You can find it at any reasonably stocked asian grocer, or you can get it online <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bull-Dog-Vegetable-Semi-Sweet-10-1-Ounce-Plastic/dp/B001B5VOEY/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1352241533&sr=1-1&keywords=bull-dog+semi+sweet">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the thing about my version of kitsune soba. The flavor is anchored in the salty, sweet, gingery broth. The tofu and vegetables are there mostly for contrasts in color, texture, and temperature. Since everything is presented plain, the broth does most the heavy lifting in the flavor department, but it also allows the raw ingredients to shine on their own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8162328055/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7135/8162328055_7e03920c61_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Soba and Broth"></a></p>
<p><strong>Kitsune Soba</strong><br />
<em>Serves Two</em></p>
<p>Oil, for frying<br />
1 Package Soba Noodles<br />
1/2 Block Extra Firm Tofu, sliced thinly<br />
1 Small Carrot, peeled and sliced paper thin<br />
Greens (microgreens, scallions, cilantro, whatever!)<br />
Bull Dog Sauce, optional<br />
Optional ideas: Sliced radish, sweet pepper, snow peas, cucumber</p>
<p><em>Broth</em><br />
2 Tbs to 1/4 Cup Low Sodium Tamari (to taste, I used the whole 1/4 Cup)<br />
1 Cup Water<br />
1 Tbs Rice Vinegar<br />
1 Tbs Sugar<br />
1/2 Vegan Bullion Cube<br />
1 Inch Ginger Root, peeled and sliced thinly </p>
<p>Add all the broth ingredients to a small pot and bring to a boil.  Turn off the heat and place a lid on the broth while preparing the rest of the meal.  This allows all the gingery goodness to steep into the broth.</p>
<p>Place a pot of lightly salted water on to boil.  Meanwhile, heat a cast iron or non-stick pan with oil, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry the tofu slices for several minutes on both sides until golden brown and very very crispy. Drain on a paper towel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8162328157/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8162328157_247734256c_b.jpg" width="1000" height="709" alt="Fried Tofu"></a></p>
<p>Once the water is boiling, add noodles and cook to package directions or until noodles are tender.  My noodles were done in only 4 minutes, but the package said 6-7 minutes, so check them early to avoid over cooking.</p>
<p>Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water.  Place the noodles in bowls and pour the hot broth over them, straining out the ginger pieces.  Top with the fried tofu, sliced, as well as your vegetables and greens.  Garnish with Bull Dog Sauce, if using.</p>
<p>You can easily make every part of this ahead, so this is a nice option for company, and it looks fancy too!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326722/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8004326722_19c173aeff_b.jpg" width="1000" height="702" alt="Curried Chips with Lemon Sunflower Spread"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick little snack I whipped up today to use up bagels and pita bread I (stupidly) bought before going out of town. Bagel and pita chips are really easy to make, and you can spice them however you like.  </p>
<p>I also bought some roasted sunflower seeds, but had a hard time imagining how I could make it through 1 1/2 cups of them before they went bad. Clearly I&#8217;m not the most practical shopper.</p>
<p>I used garam masala to flavor my chips, but you should treat any spices (and especially, any ground spice mixes you have) as fair game for this recipe. Smoked paprika? Old Bay? Japanese seven spice? Celery salt? So many possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004327064/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8004327064_28f427fdd5_b.jpg" width="1000" height="675" alt="Fresh Lemon Juice"></a></p>
<p>The sunflower dip has fresh lemon, ground white pepper, and a dash of tabasco. Here again is a lovely blank canvas for you to experiment with. If I had it available I would have added some freshly chopped mint. Roasted garlic or fresh scallions would make a lovely addition as well, for people who are normal and like those sorts of things (i.e. not me).</p>
<p>The dip is really rich and reminds me a lot of tahini (sesame seed paste) but without the bitter taste. If you want an even more pronounced lemon flavor, add the zest.  This dip can also be thinned out to form a dressing, used as a sandwich spread, or as stand in for hummus.</p>
<p><strong>Curried Chips with Lemon Sunflower Spread</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 1 cup of spread and 4 cups of chips</em></p>
<p><em>For the Chips</em><br />
1 Bagel<br />
2 Pita Bread Rounds<br />
2 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
1/2 &#8211; 1 tsp Garam Masala, or other spice mix<br />
Salt</p>
<p><em>For the Spread</em><br />
1 Cup Roasted, Salted Sunflower Seeds (shelled)<br />
1 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
Zest of 1 lemon, optional<br />
1/4 to 1/3 Cup of Lemon Juice (2-3 lemons)<br />
1 Cup Water<br />
1/4 &#8211; 1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Tabasco, more if desired<br />
White Pepper<br />
Fresh Herbs (optional, such as mint, scallions)</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326051/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/8004326051_b33855771b_b.jpg" width="1000" height="652" alt="Sliced Bagel"></a></p>
<p>Slice your bagel into thin slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Slice the pita bread rounds in half.  Stack the halves and slice into 1 inch strips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004327210/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/8004327210_4d8f23cc0f_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Spicing the Chips"></a></p>
<p>Place all the bread into a large bowl and toss well with 2 Tbs of olive oil and garam masala.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004325905/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/8004325905_8cbf361560_b.jpg" width="1000" height="723" alt="Bagel and Pita Chips Before Baking"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the chips in one layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with 2-3 pinches of salt.  If needed, add a couple extra pinches of garam masala to any bits that need it.</p>
<p>Bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 15 minutes.  Set your timer for 10 minutes and start checking them for doneness at that point. The chips are done when they are beginning to crisp and turn a lightly golden brown. Be careful not to over-bake.  Remove and let cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326992/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/8004326992_f183f9e6f2_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Sunflower Seeds"></a></p>
<p>Add the sunflower meats to a food processor and turn it on.  While running, add the oil and lemon juice and zest. Slowly add in the water until a smooth, creamy dip is formed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004325677/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8004325677_16d2dbcf32_b.jpg" width="1000" height="731" alt="Lemon Sunflower Spread with White Pepper"></a></p>
<p>Remove to a bowl and whisk in the salt, to taste, and the black pepper and tobasco.  If needed, add more liquid to get the texture you like.  Once the dip is ready, gently fold in any fresh chopped herbs you may be using.</p>
<p>The recipe makes a rather mild dip that would be appropriate even for kids&#8217; palates, so feel free to bump up the spices, tobasco, and lemon juice of you want something a bit zippier!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472514/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/7984472514_2e9a1776ce_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mushroom season! </p>
<p>I recently went on a wild edible plant walk here in the Boston area, and our guide told us that the best time to find mushrooms is between Labor Day and Columbus Day. We didn&#8217;t find any mushrooms on our walk, but he did get me thinking about making a recipe to show them off. I&#8217;m really interested in learning more about local wild, edible plants, so hopefully I&#8217;l be rooting around in the woods for some fungus soon.</p>
<p>And if you made the <a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">black pepper and cumin pickled carrots</a> from last week, here&#8217;s a recipe to try them with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473338/" title="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7984473338_48facfa999_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Any wild mushrooms will do for this recipe, but I picked out two of my favorites today: oyster mushrooms and chanterelles.  </p>
<p>Oyster mushrooms can be cultivated, so you are likely to find them outside of peak mushroom season. This also helps make them a bit more affordable than wild harvested mushrooms, but they are still many, many rungs up the ladder from the budget workhorse that is white button mushroom.  If you are interested, there are many resources online that describe how you can grow oyster mushrooms yourself, at home.</p>
<p>Chanterelles, however, do not cooperate with human cultivation. This means the mushrooms you see in the store were growing wild in a wood somewhere before they reached the shelves. The effort it takes to locate and collect them, their wonderfully complex flavor, and their perishable nature contribute to their price tag. </p>
<p>A note about using wild mushrooms: if you&#8217;re super squicky about eating a little dirt, this may not be the best food for you.  Washing mushrooms makes them soggy and sad.  I pick off anything that&#8217;s big enough to be picked off, and then chop it up and cook away without thinking too hard about what might be on them.  As long as the mushrooms are not slimy, don&#8217;t have any overly soft spots, aren&#8217;t hiding bugs, and don&#8217;t smell off&#8230; they are declared clean in my kitchen.  A little dirt from the middle of a forest won&#8217;t hurt you.</p>
<p>And if you found your own, just be careful!  Make sure you know what you have before you eat it.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Tostadas with Lime Creme Fraiche </strong><br />
<em>Makes Six Tostadas</em></p>
<p>Six Corn Tortillas<br />
Wild Mushroom Filling (recipe below)<br />
Lime Creme Fraiche (recipe below)<br />
1 Jalapeno Pepper, sliced thinly<br />
1 Small Bunch Fresh Cilantro Leaves, roughly chopped<br />
12 Pickled Carrot Sticks (<a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">recipe here</a>)<br />
1 Cup Daiya Vegan Cheese Shreds<br />
Oil </p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Filling</strong><br />
340g or 3/4lb Wild Mushrooms, weighed after trimming<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cumin<br />
1/2 tsp Dried Oregano<br />
1 tsp Earth Balance Spread or Oil<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p><strong>Lime Creme Fraiche</strong><br />
4 Tbs Tofutti Cream Cheese<br />
4 Tbs Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lime Juice</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473256/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7984473256_7cd4f2c24d_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopped Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the racks in your oven so one is in the middle and one is in the highest position.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
<p>Chop your mushrooms into a medium to small dice.  Add them to a dry skillet over medium high heat.  The mushrooms will begin to release moisture after a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473186/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7984473186_3448562707_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Wild Mushroom Filling"></a></p>
<p>After 3-4 minutes of cooking, add the salt, cumin and oregano. Keep an eye on the mushrooms and stir them every 10-15 seconds. Once most of the moisture has cooked out and they begin sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 7 minutes of total cooking time, add the Earth Balance and mix well.  Remove mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473120/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/7984473120_ee4d9234cc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Corn Tortillas"></a></p>
<p>Place six corn tortillas on a baking sheet.  Brush both sides very lightly with olive oil.  Put tortillas in the middle rack of the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes.  The edges of the tortilla should be beginning to curl and they should only barely have the slightest hint of color.  Remove from oven.</p>
<p>While the tortillas are baking, mix together the ingredients for the creme fraiche and refrigerate until ready to use.  It will take a lot of whisking to get the mixture smooth, but it will happen if you keep at it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984467283/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7984467283_24cb149b99_b.jpg" width="1000" height="808" alt="Mushroom, Jalapeno, Cilantro"></a></p>
<p>Once your tortillas are out of the oven, change the oven to the broil setting.  Get everything ready for assembly: sliced jalapenos, cilantro, carrot sticks, cheese, creme fraiche, mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472966/" title="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/7984472966_e8e2f67948_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>Evenly divide the mushroom mixture across the tortillas.  Top with a little vegan cheese.  Place in the oven, this time on the very top rack, to broil.  DO NOT WALK AWAY!  Watch them as they cook until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden brown.  Remove immediately.</p>
<p>Top each tostada with a dollop of the lime creme fraiche, some cilantro, a slice or two of jalapeno, and two picked carrot sticks.  Serve immediately.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945782884/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/7945782884_729f0b35a0_b.jpg" width="1000" height="806" alt="Pickled Carrots with Cumin and Black Pepper"></a></p>
<p>Black pepper and cumin are two things that I can never have enough of.  </p>
<p>Pickles, on the other hand, I can usually do with a lot less of.  Or, you know, none. None&#8217;s fine. Pickles live in the part of my brain labeled <em>yuck</em>.</p>
<p>I was talking to my friend Bill and mentioned my dislike for pickled things.  The conversation went a bit like this after my confession:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like vinegar?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you like sugar?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you like salt?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you like vegetables?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Well, then you like all that stuff together.  You like pickles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of embarrassing to be really into food but dislike things that are wildly popular. (We&#8217;ve discussed my dislike of garlic previously, but that&#8217;s another post.  And a lost cause.) Every so often I revisit my blacklist and see if anything on it can be crossed off. Oftentimes I try to overcome my dislikes by forcing myself to try them in new ways until something starts to click.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945784914/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/7945784914_f4cdbc75f2_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Cumin and Black Pepper"></a></p>
<p>My conversation with Bill rattled around in my head for a bit and I realized that he&#8217;s probably right.  I would probably like pickles, provided they were made in a way I liked, with spices I&#8217;m fond of.  Skip the dill, get rid of the garlic, and maybe, to be safe, start with something that isn&#8217;t a cucumber.  Baby steps.  Pickle therapy.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945784662/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/7945784662_8b3f1f8f1f.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Fresh Cumin" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px"></a>Now, a note on spices.  Do you have whole spices at home?  Are they sort of fresh?  I like whole spices, but I am guilty of letting them sit for longer than they should.  Think about what&#8217;s in your rack right now and be honest &#8212; when was the last time you replaced stuff? Did you purchase them from somewhere that has high-turnover, or had they been sitting for months before you brought them home?  </p>
<p>If you want to get back on the fresh spice train, and don&#8217;t think your local stores have anything worth investing in, find yourself a quality spice store that takes online orders.  I have used <a href="http://www.thespicehouse.com/">The Spice House</a> back in my home state of Illinois for years and am always impressed with their stuff. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to have fresh cumin, but please please please tell me you are using whole peppercorns, in a grinder.  If I could only have one whole spice in my house it would absolutely be black pepper.  Pre-ground pepper is sad.  Fresh, whole peppercorns are amazing.  Swoon-worthy.  Get some.</p>
<p>Okay, enough yapping.  On to the recipe.  I was heavily influenced by <A href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/11/easy-pickled-carrots/">this post</a> by David Lebovitz during my carrot pickle research, so many thanks to him and his informative post.</p>
<p><strong>Pickled Carrots</strong><br />
<em>For a 1 pint jar</em></p>
<p>1 Pound Carrots (about 5-6), peeled and chopped as described<br />
1 1/4 Cups Water<br />
1 Cup Vinegar (cider, white wine, etc)<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
1 1/2 Tbs Salt<br />
1 Tbs Whole Cumin Seeds<br />
1 Tbs Freshly Ground Black Pepper<br />
2 Bay Leaves (optional)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945784464/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7945784464_0f40f3180c_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Pickling Spices"></a></p>
<p>Mix together your picking spices and set aside.  Put a pot of salted water on to boil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945784278/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8306/7945784278_f4b0cf6bab_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Carrots"></a></p>
<p>One pound of carrots is roughly equivalent to 5 or 6 large carrots.  If you have a choice, pick out fewer large, thick carrots as opposed to more thin carrots.  Thicker carrots will be much easier to chop up.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945784118/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7945784118_65dfddd79b_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopping Carrots"></a></p>
<p>After your carrots are peeled, stand one up in your jar and chop it to 1 or 1 1/2 inches from the rim.  Use this piece of a carrot as a template to chop all the carrots down to the correct size.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945783910/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/7945783910_47d481a5cc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopping Carrots"></a></p>
<p>Once all your carrots are the correct size, chop each piece in half lengthwise to give a nice sturdy base (carrot above, on the left).  With a large, sharp chef&#8217;s knife (bigger is easier for this task), begin slicing the carrots lengthwise into 1/8 or 1/16 inch thicknesses.  You don&#8217;t have to go crazy or be a perfectionist.  You want them thin enough to take to the picking liquid, but thick enough to retain crunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945783746/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7945783746_910c2beb87_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopped Carrots"></a></p>
<p>Once all the carrots are chopped, drop them into the boiling water for 1-2 minutes.  You do not want to over-cook them, you just want to loosen them up a bit so they can take to the pickling easier.  </p>
<p>Drain the carrots well, and add the remaining ingredients to the hot pan.  Bring to a simmer and let cook on low for another 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945783556/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7945783556_42c7dfc3bc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cooling"></a></p>
<p>Add the blanched carrots to the liquid and let sit until room temperature, or at least cool enough to handle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945783370/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7945783370_d8442ba42e_b.jpg" width="1000" height="991" alt="Jarring the pickles"></a></p>
<p>With VERY clean hands, load up the pickles into your jar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7945783078/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7945783078_4f26277a45_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Jarring the pickles"></a></p>
<p>Pour the picking liquid and all the spices into the jar.  </p>
<p>Place your jar in the fridge.  They will be ready to eat in 24 hours, and should keep for a good two weeks.  They are great with your favorite vegan cheese and crackers, mixed into salad, with tacos, in sushi, falafel, or on their own.</p>
<p>They are pretty damn good.  If I like them, you probably will, too.</p>
<p>By the way, as an experiment, I used a tiny bit of the hot pickling liquid and poured it over freshly sliced cucumbers.  That works, too, and they remain crisp.  The liquid should work with just about anything you have on hand!</p>

<p>Well.  Hello!  I&#8217;ve missed you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last two years working in animal rescue, but it&#8217;s time to dust off the blog and get back in the kitchen. Today I have a super simple but delicious appetizer to share with you.  It&#8217;s very nearly September and I am desperately clinging to the last gasps of summer.  This might just be my favorite time of year; farmer&#8217;s markets are overflowing and I fall in love with ingredients I&#8217;ve taken for granted all over again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978904/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8300/7888978904_3221d4bcc5.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomato Canapés"></a></p>
<p>Case in point: the tomato. </p>
<p>This recipe was made for the late-summer haul of juicy, sweet, perfect tomatoes. Use tomatoes worthy of a spotlight. If you happen to be growing your own grape tomatoes (and your own basil!) than this has got your name all over it.  It&#8217;s quick to prepare and tastes great at room temperature, so you can make a bunch and let your dinner party guests enjoy them at their leisure.  Perhaps on a deck with a nice bottle of red? I don&#8217;t have a deck, and didn&#8217;t throw a party, so I won&#8217;t tell if you just make these for yourself as a light snack on a weekend afternoon.  They are so easy you can absolutely make them without an occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Blackened Tomato Canapés</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 25 pieces</em></p>
<p>1 Pint Cherry Tomatoes<br />
Around 7 Slices of Sourdough Bread<br />
25 Basil Leaves<br />
1 Cup Balsamic Vinegar (or prepared/purchased balsamic glaze)<br />
Olive Oil<br />
Sea or Kosher Salt<br />
Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</p>
<p>Start off by preparing the crostini. Arrange your oven racks so you have one at the very top and set your oven to Broil.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888980400/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7888980400_4f2875958c.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Slice the sourdough into bite-sized triangles.  I like to cut the bottom crust off with a long chef&#8217;s knife (helps you get a nice clean edge) and create one big triangle.  Slice that in half for two triangles, and each of those in half again.  Each piece of bread should give you 4 small triangles.  You can save the scraps to make your own breadcrumbs, or toss them to the birds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888980222/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7888980222_e5a883ed94.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and brush lightly on one side with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979950/"> <img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/7888979950_06ca67c013.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Season generously with sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper.  I like to go a little crazy with the black pepper, but if you don&#8217;t like its signature heat, you can ease up on it.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979650/"> <img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7888979650_d62cf25922.jpg" width="500" alt="Seasoned Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Broil for 2-4 minutes (watching constantly) until perfectly golden.  Remove from oven and set aside.  Do not walk away from these while they are in the oven or they will burn up!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979398/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/7888979398_273abf53a8.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomatoes"></a></p>
<p>Now grab your cast-iron skillet and put it over high heat, very lightly oiled.  You can make the tomatoes in a regular pan if you don&#8217;t have cast-iron, but a cast-iron pan is perfect for this application.  Once the pan starts to smoke, add the tomatoes.  Every 10 seconds or so, gently shake the pan to toss the tomatoes around.  We are looking to char the skin a little while only lightly cooking the tomatoes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you need to make your own balsamic glaze, add 1 cup of balsamic vinegar to a small sauce pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce about 75%, until it becomes a thick glaze, being careful not to burn.  Set aside when done.  This takes about 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979156/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7888979156_4910261cb6.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomatoes"></a></p>
<p>The tomatoes are done when the skin is speckled with black char and begins to split.  You are not making tomato sauce, so don&#8217;t overcook them until they are mushy.  We want quick cooking over very high heat (about 5 minutes total) to add flavor but to keep the individual tomatoes whole.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978692/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7888978692_03e1021042.jpg" width="500" alt="Assembly"></a></p>
<p>Once all your ingredients are ready, begin assembly by placing a single basil leaf on each piece of crostini.  I like to flip the leaf inside out to create a little boat for the tomato to sit in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978358/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7888978358_9f2e045bdd.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomato Canapés"></a></p>
<p>Top each piece with a single tomato and drizzle the balsamic glaze over the top.  If you did not salt the bread enough before baking, you may wish to add a little pinch of salt over the top, but taste it first to be sure!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  If you happen to have leftover tomatoes, they would be a wonderful addition to just about any recipe.  I think they would be killer in pasta or chopped up as a salsa base.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978076/"> <img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7888978076_481b5cd29d.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomato Canapés"></a></p>

<p>Yes, I know.  It&#8217;s a salad.  </p>
<p>Who wants to go to a vegan website and see a recipe for salad?  I keep salads to an absolute minimum around here.  So when one does show up, it&#8217;s a freakin&#8217; delicious salad.  </p>
<p>And this one is definitely freakin&#8217; delicious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the idea of an avocado based salad dressing kicking around in my head for the last few days, and an avocado kicking around my kitchen counter.  This salad is easy to throw together, and is a great entree salad, or a side salad for a dinner party or some such get-together.</p>
<p>The dressing is rich, and despite the title, is pretty damn tasty even without the added wasabi.  You have my permission to leave the wasabi powder out altogether if you don&#8217;t like it or can&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if my wasabi powder is old and has lost its kick, or if you need a massive amount of it to make things spicy (anyone with experience want to weigh in?), but this dressing was as mild as the day is long.  It added a great flavor, but no heat.  You may wish to add in your own wasabi powder slowly, tasting as you go, just in case yours is spicy.</p>
<p>The other ingredients are simple but flavorful as well.  Pan-fried wasabi-soy chickpeas, sauteed broccoli, toasted almonds, and shredded carrots.  I find this mixture goes particularly well together, adding crunch, sweetness, protein, and color.  And they all pair wonderfully with the dressing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4309217553/" title="Avocado Wasabi Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4309217553_1ddcb13eaf.jpg" width="450" alt="Avocado Wasabi Salad" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of the dressing, it&#8217;s pretty ugly stuff.  This isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re going to want to serve on the side for your guests.  Toss it with the lettuce and then serve it.  Just trust me on this one.  You&#8217;ll see when you make it.  </p>
<p><strong>Avocado Wasabi Salad</strong><br />
<em>Serves 4-6</em></p>
<p>Greens of your choice for 4-6 people<br />
1 Carrot, shredded<br />
2 tsp Vegetable Oil, divided<br />
1/2 to 3/4 Cup Broccoli, chopped small<br />
1/3 Cup Toasted Slivered Almonds<br />
1 Recipe Wasabi Chickpeas, below<br />
1 Recipe Avocado Wasabi dressing, below<br />
Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</p>
<p><em>Wasabi-Tamari Chickpeas</em><br />
1 tsp Oil<br />
1 Cup Chickpeas<br />
1 tsp Wasabi Powder<br />
1/2 tsp Sugar<br />
1 Tbs Low Sodium Tamari/Soy Sauce</p>
<p><em>Avocado Wasabi Dressing</em><br />
1 Ripe Avocado, diced<br />
2 tsp White Wine Vinegar<br />
3 Tbs Hummus, plain or garlic<br />
1 tsp Stoneground Mustard<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
2 tsp Wasabi Powder<br />
1/4 to 1/3 Cup Vegetable oil</p>
<p>Begin by whisking the dressing ingredients together, except for the oil.  Whisk until smooth.  If your avocado isn&#8217;t super ripe, you may wish to blend the dressing in a food processor.  Slowly add oil until emulsified and the dressing is smooth, refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<p>Toast your almonds in a dry pan over medium heat if they are not already toasted.  Set aside.</p>
<p>In the same pan, add 1 tsp of oil and add broccoli.  Sautee over high heat until the broccoli is beginning to color in spots and is bright green, but still tender-crisp.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside.</p>
<p>Add the second teaspoon of oil to the same pan and add the chickpeas.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Cook the chickpeas until they are golden on all sides, using a spatula to loosen them as necessary, but don&#8217;t worry if they stick a little.  Add the wasabi powder, sugar, and tamari and stir well.  Remove from pan and set aside.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, add your salad greens.  Add the broccoli, 3/4 of the chickpeas, 3/4 of the almonds, and 3/4 of the carrots.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Plate the salad, and garnish the top with the remaining chickpeas, almonds and carrots.  Crack fresh black pepper over the top.  Serve immediately.  </p>
<p>If you are serving the salad later, do not add the dressing until the last minute.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285956/" title="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2747/4291285956_4ba2fc6492_o.jpg" width="450" alt="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki" /></a></p>
<p>So how about we get this yummy vegan train back up and running again?  Let&#8217;s talk teriyaki.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a real teriyaki sauce, but it&#8217;s definitely inspired by one.  Teriyaki sauce is one of those things that is really easy to make at home successfully, so if you&#8217;ve been going without or buying expensive bottles of the stuff, you can stop!  It literally has three ingredients, but you can obviously get fancier with it if you like.  </p>
<p>Soy Sauce<br />
Sugar<br />
Mirin or Sake</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, people.  Mix, reduce over heat, and eat up.</p>
<p>So this sauce isn&#8217;t really a teriyaki sauce because I use rice vinegar instead of mirin.  Mirin is a sweet, thick rice wine that&#8217;s very commonly used in Japanese cooking, but I happen to be out of it at the moment.  I&#8217;ve found that rice vinegar makes a good substitute (though not 1:1, necessarily), and can be much easier to find in supermarkets.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is a common substitution or not, and perhaps people familiar with Japanese cooking would screw up their face at the idea, but it works. And it&#8217;s tasty.  So there you have it.</p>
<p>I also added clementine zest and juice to my teriyaki sauce.  I love the sweetness and the bright citrus note it adds to the dish.  I think any citrus you have would work here, and you can even leave it out altogether if you like (sub water for the juice, add a little more sugar if you like). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285482/" title="Clementine Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4291285482_4d2a6e1b8f.jpg" width="450" alt="Clementine Zest" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s winter, and it&#8217;s high season for clementines.  If you haven&#8217;t already picked up one of those enticing wooden crates full of them at the supermarket, I encourage you to do so.  They are sweet, seedless, easy to peel, and all-around amazing.  You will finish the entire crate, I promise you.  And if not, now you have a recipe to use some of them in.  And if you still have leftovers, send them to me.</p>

<p>As with most of my recipes, this one is pretty flexible.  I used broccolini because I LOVE the stuff, but regular broccoli, asparagus, or your favorite veggie will stand in nicely.  I served this with sushi rice, but noodles would be welcome.  The seitan is perfect here, but tofu or even tempeh would be lovely as well.  Orange juice will cover for clementine.  This is a great recipe to adapt to use your favorite ingredients, or at least the ones you have sitting in your fridge at the moment.</p>
<p>If you like, add some sesame oil, or garlic, or ginger to the sauce.  I love it how it is, and appreciate its simplicity, but this sauce can be used more as a base sauce you can embellish any which way you like. </p>

<p><strong>Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki</strong><br />
<em>Serves Two</em></p>
<p>8 Ounces Sliced Seitan (I use West Soy brand)<br />
1 Cup Sushi RIce<br />
6-8 Stalks of Broccolini<br />
2 Clementines<br />
1 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nanami-Togarashi-Japanese-Mixed-Pepper/dp/B000FL1U80">Japanese Seven Spice</a>, optional</p>
<p><em>Clementine Teriyaki Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Low Sodium Tamari<br />
1/3 Cup Light Brown Sugar<br />
1/3 Cup Fresh Clementine Juice<br />
1/4 Cup + 1 Tbs Rice Vinegar<br />
1/4 Cup Water<br />
Zest from 1 Clementine</p>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in cool water and drain.  Cook in your rice cooker or on the stove according to package directions, but 1 cup of sushi rice is usually cooked in 1 1/4 cups of water.  Allow to cook completely and steam for 5-10 minutes off the heat while you are preparing the rest of the meal.  Total cooking time for the rice will be around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small pan let it go at a lively simmer for 20 minutes, until reduced and slightly thick.  The sauce will NOT be super thick when it is hot.  It will very slightly cover the back of a spoon and look syrupy, but it&#8217;s not going to be thick until it cools, so don&#8217;t worry if it seems runny.  At the end of the cooking you should see large, excited bubbles (this is the sugar caramelizing), so if you don&#8217;t see those, keep cooking.  Once the sauce is done, it&#8217;ll taste good but pretty strong.  Set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4290545587/" title="Sliced Seitan by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4290545587_dfa5901b96.jpg" width="450" alt="Sliced Seitan" /></a></p>
<p>While the sauce and the rice are cooking, prepare your seitan and broccolini.  Slice the seitan into 1/8&#8243; thick medallions, or something similar.  I usually don&#8217;t prep broccolini any more than rinsing it and chopping off the ends, but if the stalks are particularly thick, you may wish to half them lengthwise.  This shouldn&#8217;t be the case with most bunches you find in the store, however.</p>
<p>Heat a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium high heat.  Add the seitan and let brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove to a bowl, turn up the heat to high, and add broccolini in one layer.  Once you get color on one side, flip, reduce heat to low, and cover the pan to finish the cooking, another 2-3 minutes.  The broccolini should be bright green and cooked to a tender-crisp.  </p>
<p>Once you are ready to serve, add the seitan to the pan with the broccolini.  Drizze enough teriyaki sauce in to coat everything.  Beware, if the pan is too hot you risk burning your sauce, so take good care here.  Once everything is heated and covered in a nice glaze, serve immediately with the sushi rice.  Top with seven spice if you like a little heat.</p>
<p>This sauce is strong so you just need enough to coat &#8212; save any extra for a future meal. </p>

<p>Alright, are you ready for the first recipe preview from the VYY cookbook?</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite recipes in the book.  I make it almost once a week.  It&#8217;s the perfect creamy pasta sauce when you&#8217;re feeling like alfredo.  It&#8217;s also a great sauce for casseroles, over steamed veggies, on top of lasagna &#8212; wherever you want a basic creamy sauce.  So not only is it really versatile, but it&#8217;s also really quick!</p>
<p>The whole sauce is made in a blender, so the faster you can toss ingredients into a blender, the faster it&#8217;s done.  This also makes it super easy for additions.  Recently I&#8217;ve been adding whole roasted red peppers (the kind they sell water-packed in jars).</p>
<p><strong>Hurry Up Alfredo</strong><br />
<em>Makes 2-3 Servings</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Soymilk<br />
1/3 Cup Raw, Unsalted Cashews<br />
1/4 Cup Nutritional Yeast<br />
3 Tbs Low-Sodium Tamari or Soy Sauce<br />
2 Tbs Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1 Tbs Tahini<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/2 tsp Paprika (smoked is awesome)<br />
1 Pinch Nutmeg<br />
2-4 Cloves of Garlic, optional<br />
Black pepper, to taste</p>
<p>Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth.  This may work best in a high-speed blender (like a Vita-Mix), but you can definitely make it in a regular blender.  Just blend extra-long, or perhaps strain if if you want it perfectly smooth.  Tiny bits of cashews won&#8217;t hurt anyone though!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re making this sauce for pasta, drain the pasta and return it to the hot empty pan.  Pour the sauce over, place on medium heat, and stir until heated through.  Serve with lots of fresh cracked black pepper.  I love it with steamed broccoli added in!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927905/" title="Plum Kuchen by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3769927905_274295ab29.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen" /></a></p>
<p>Kuchen means cake in German.  There are as many different kinds of kuchen as there are kinds of cake.</p>
<p>I saw this recipe for upside-down plum kuchen in the latest issue of Gourmet Magazine, and I just had veganize it.  I&#8217;m glad I did, because the cake base of this kuchen might now be my favorite coffee cake base ever.  It&#8217;s light and fluffy, and like my <a href="../../../2009/07/slow-rise-pancakes/index.html">Slow Rise Pancakes</a>, it uses yeast instead of baking powder or baking soda for leavening.  I really love the clean, rich flavor of yeast-raised goods, so when I looked at this particular recipe I knew I had to make an animal-friendly version.</p>
<p>They used plums in the Gourmet version, so when I found tiny, sweet organic plums at the Copley Farmers Market here in Boston, it was kismet.  However, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d recommend you use plums in yours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927629/" title="Organic Plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3769927629_e7f25529d8.jpg" width="450" alt="Organic Plums" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  The plums themselves are very sweet, but I noticed a mild bitterness in the skins, even when I ate them fresh.  After baking, the bitterness intensified.  It&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing, it&#8217;s similar to the bitterness of marmalade.  If you really love the combination of sweet and bitter in a fruit, then go for the plums.  If you&#8217;re not sure, choose another stone fruit; peaches or cherries would be completely divine in this.  On second thought, I think nearly any bake-able fruit would be great.</p>
<p>Because this is a yeast-risen cake, it does take a while.  Two hours for the first rise and ninety minutes for the second rise means this isn&#8217;t a fast dessert.  If you&#8217;re looking for a quick coffee cake, try this <A href="../../../2008/06/crumb-cake/index.html">crumb cake</a> instead.  But the flavor and texture of this kuchen really make all the time worthwhile. </p>
<p><strong>Plum Kuchen <em>(adapted from Gourmet Magazine, Aug 2009)</em></strong><br />
<em>Makes One 9&#215;9 Cake</em></p>
<p>1 Packet Active-Dry Yeast (2 1/4 tsp)<br />
1/4 Cup Warm Water (105-110º F)<br />
2 Cups plus 2 Tbs All-Purpose Flour, divided<br />
1 Cup Sugar, divided<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/2 Cup plus 1 Tbs Tofutti Sour Cream (or plain vegan yogurt)<br />
2 tsp Ener-G Egg Replacer Powder mixed with 3 Tbs Hot Water<br />
1 1/2 tsp Fresh Lemon Zest<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbs Earth Balance Margarine, divided<br />
3/4 lbs Firm-Ripe Plums or other Stone Fruit, halved and pitted</p>
<p>Combine the yeast with the warm water and set aside to proof until foamy.</p>
<p>In a mixing bowl (one that fits in a stand mixer, if you have one), combine the yeast with 2 cups flour, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, sour cream, egg replacer, lemon zest, and vanilla extract.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927547/" title="Lemon Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2431/3769927547_9d17db82c5.jpg" width="450" alt="Lemon Zest" /></a></p>
<p>Beat at low speed to combine the ingredients, then mix at medium speed for 5 minutes while adding in 1/2 cup of Earth Balance, one tablespoon at a time.  Beat the batter for five minutes at medium speed until smooth and shiny, and very sticky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927595/" title="Batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2467/3769927595_dbb867d85c.jpg" width="450" alt="Batter" /></a></p>
<p>After five minutes, remove the bowl from the mixer and top with the remaining 2 Tbs of flour.  Do not mix it in.  Cover the bowl with a non-terry cloth kitchen towel and set aside to rise for 90 minutes to 2 hours.</p>
<p>After the first rise, mix the the dough to combine the flour on the top.</p>
<p>With the remaining 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance, grease a 9&#215;9 cake pan.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>Halve and pit the plums.  It may be easier to cut around the pits, rather than to pull them out, if your fruit is very ripe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727894/" title="Organic Plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3558/3770727894_e8ec8860ca.jpg" width="450" alt="Organic Plums" /></a></p>
<p>Slice the pitted plum halves into five or six slices.  I left mine whole because they were very small. Place cut-side down into the sugar, covering the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3769927733/" title="Plum Kuchen, plums by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/3769927733_8552d6438e.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen, plums" /></a></p>
<p>Pour the dough over the plums and let raise for another 90 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727964/" title="Plum Kuchen, batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3428/3770727964_56bf5b37d1.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen, batter" /></a></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375º F.</p>
<p>Bake the kuchen for 35 minutes, until evenly golden and slightly cracked.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3770727998/" title="Plum Kuchen by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/3770727998_bbf98632fb.jpg" width="450" alt="Plum Kuchen" /></a></p>
<p>Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes.  Loosen edges with a knife and turn out onto a rack to cool completely before serving.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105439/" title="BLT Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2566/3743105439_04878091ec.jpg" width="450" alt="BLT Salad" /></a></p>
<p>This salad isn&#8217;t exactly&#8230; healthy.  What it <i>is</i>, exactly, is delicious.  And it has a surprise.  There&#8217;s no lettuce.  The greens are baby spinach, and raw kale.</p>
<p>Stay with me, here!</p>
<p>Yes, I said raw kale.  I know you are thinking that I have finally gone off the vegan deep end.  But I swear, the water is nice!</p>
<p>You can eat raw kale, too, if you pay attention to these three things: the kind, the cut, and the preparation.  Follow these three steps and I swear you&#8217;ll be eating your kale raw and loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Kind</strong><br />
The first step is finding the right kind of kale.  Lacinato kale is perfectly suited to eating raw.  I find that it&#8217;s thinner and more tender than the other varieties, but sadly, it&#8217;s not nearly as common.  Look for long, thin, flat leaves that are slightly dimpled.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897286/" title="Lacinato Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3420/3743897286_bc3b21d4ce.jpg" width="450" alt="Lacinato Kale" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not always obvious what the best cut is for a certain dish.  Small, thin strips of kale is integral for this salad, or any meal where the kale is served raw or lightly cooked.  When the kale is cut this way, the dressing has a much easier time tenderizing the kale without having to cook it.  Larger pieces of kale would be much harder to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />
With regular lettuce, you wait to add the dressing until just before serving.  Otherwise the salt and acid in the dressing starts to break down the fresh, crisp greens, leaving you with a soggy mess.  With a kale salad, this is to your advantage!  Dress the salad ahead of time and refrigerate it for a bit.  The dressing will soften up the kale just the right amount.  Plus, the addition of a creamy dressing compliments kale&#8217;s flavors nicely.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897708/" title="BLT Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3743897708_8ebeec3256.jpg" width="450" alt="BLT Salad" /></a></p>
<p>There are many fake bacon products out there.  My favorite is what I&#8217;ve used in this recipe, Lightlife&#8217;s Smoky Tempeh Strips.  While the package says &#8220;Fakin&#8217; Bacon&#8221; I find that it&#8217;s not at all like what I remember of the real thing, but I still like it.  It&#8217;s smoky and salty and tangy, and it&#8217;s AWESOME in this salad (or on sandwiches).  But as awesome as it is, bacon it is not.  If you&#8217;re looking for something that more closely approximates the texture and flavor of bacon, there are probably other brands out there, but I haven&#8217;t found one that I like.</p>
<p>One last note: due to the sturdy nature of kale, this is the perfect picnic and pot luck salad.  You can throw it together ahead of time and it&#8217;ll be perky and crisp when you get around to serving it.  If you&#8217;re looking for a side dish that can stand up to summer entertaining, this recipe is a good bet.</p>
<p><strong>BLT Salad</strong><br />
<em>4-6 Side Salads</em></p>
<p>1 Head Lacinato Kale (aka Tuscan or Dinosaur Kale)*<br />
1 Package <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=tempeh_smokystrips">Lightelife Organic Smoky Tempeh Strips</a>**<br />
2 Tbs Peanut Oil, divided<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Baby Spinach, Packed<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Sweet Cherry Tomatoes (about 25)</p>
<p><em>Dressing</em><br />
1/4 Cup Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Agave Nectar<br />
Freshly Ground Black Pepper</p>
<p><em>*You can also use regular lettuce if you like, just make sure not to add the dressing until just before serving.</em></p>
<p><em>**Sub baked tofu, another mock bacon, or my <a href="../../../2008/07/smokey-miso-tofu/index.html">Smoky Miso Tofu</a>.</em></p>
<p>Wash and dry kale. Using kitchen shears (or a knife, or your fingers), remove and discard the center stem from each leaf.  I find scissors makes the job quick and easy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105005/" title="Deveining Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3743105005_b7af46a4b0.jpg" width="450" alt="Deveining Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the kale leaves on top of each other and slice into thin strips with a sharp knife:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105089/" title="Chopping Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3743105089_379527acb3.jpg" width="450" alt="Chopping Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Place the cut kale into a large bowl.  Whisk the dressing together and toss with the kale until evenly coated.  If you are using regular lettuce, keep the dressing separate until just before serving.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, longer is no problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prepare the &#8220;bacon.&#8221;  Slice the tempeh strips into thin, small pieces, and pan-fry in 1 Tbs peanut oil for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp on the edges.  Drain on a paper towel and set aside:</p>

<p>Next, add another tablespoon of peanut oil to the same pan you cooked the bacon in (don&#8217;t wash it out!).  Cook the tomatoes with 1/4 tsp salt for 3 minutes over high heat, or until beginning to soften and the juices are starting to come out.  Remove to a bowl, with juices, and set aside.</p>
<p><strong>Assembling the salad</strong></p>
<p>Once you are ready to serve the salad, chop up the baby spinach and toss it with the kale, making sure everything is now covered in dressing.  If you are using regular lettuce, mix in the dressing now.  Add 3/4 of the bacon and the tomatoes and toss again.  Plate, topping the salad with the rest of the bacon and some freshly cracked black pepper.  Serve.</p>
