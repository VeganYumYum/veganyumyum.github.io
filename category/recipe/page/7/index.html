				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848517/" title="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3528848517_ba3b8a03fc.jpg" width="450" alt="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>My husband and I have been watching The Sopranos recently (yes, I&#8217;m apparently 10 years behind the curve here), and I can only listen to the characters talk about manicotti and baked ziti so many times before I get a serious craving for some Italian food.  It got me thinking to a public television cooking show I saw a while ago, <a href="http://www.lidiasitaly.com/tv-show">Lidia&#8217;s Italy</a>.  I remember she made a lasagna that used bread instead of noodles, and it struck me as brilliant.  </p>
<p>I know making pasta isn&#8217;t hard, but there&#8217;s something about boiling lasagna noodles that is a huge pain in the ass.  They&#8217;re huge, you must not over cook them, you have to prevent them from sticking to each other after draining&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;m just lazy, but the idea of using bread really caught my attention.  Of course, I couldn&#8217;t find Lydia&#8217;s recipe to go from, so this version is totally made up by me.  But not only do I want to credit her for general inspiration, she also has an Italian cooking show, so she gives my crazy bread lasagna some legitimacy.  Maybe.  Shhh.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to use is a loaf of pre-sliced, crusty sourdough.  I know I recommend sourdough for everything, but really, it&#8217;s awesome in this dish.  You want the favor, of course, but you also want a sturdy &#8220;artisan&#8221; type bread that won&#8217;t fall apart in the oven.  This isn&#8217;t a job for sliced sandwich bread.  It&#8217;s best with bread that is even perhaps a little stale.  Look for a quality sliced loaf in the day old section of your grocer and save a buck or two.</p>
<p>You can put absolutely anything in this lasagna.  I picked eggplants because I had three of them.  I think they are lovely in this, so I recommend them, but really, stuff this with whatever you like or whatever is handy.</p>
<p><strong>Rustic Bread &#038; Eggplant Lasagna</strong><br />
<em>Serves 9-12</em></p>
<p>3 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
4-6 Cloves Garlic, minced (optional)<br />
2 28 oz Cans Organic Tomatoes, blended<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
4 tsp Dried Italian Herbs<br />
Olive Oil, for drizzling<br />
2-3 Medium Eggplants, peeled<br />
8-10 Large Slices of Sourdough Bread<br />
1 Cup Breadcrumbs (or 2 more pieces of bread for toasting and food processing)<br />
1-2 Large, Ripe Tomatoes, fresh, for garnish<br />
Basil, for garnish</p>
<p>In a very large skillet with high sides, or a sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.  Sweat the garlic for 1-2 minutes, then add tomatoes, salt, and herbs.  Cook for 30 minutes (bubbling), stirring occasionally.  Invert a mesh strainer over the top of the pan to prevent splatter, if desired.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400º F.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prep two baking sheets with parchment paper.  Peel the eggplants by slicing off the top and bottom and using the cut edge to start your vegetable peeler.  Holding the eggplant vertically, cut the eggplants into 1/2 inch slices.  Arrange in one layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and drizzle liberally with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660042/" title="Eggplant before roasting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/3529660042_3b549a2597.jpg" width="450" alt="Eggplant before roasting" /></a></p>
<p>Bake eggplant for 30-40 minutes at 400º, turning once, until very, very soft and browned in some places.</p>
<p>Spray both sides of each slice of bread with spray oil and &#8220;grill&#8221; in a hot skillet until browned on both sides.  You can also simply toast the bread, but I think you get more flavor with grilling.</p>
<p>In a large baking dish (a lasagna dish), spread 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce.  Line the bottom of the dish with bread, filling as many as the gaps as possible without overlapping.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660088/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2058/3529660088_c32010c4dc.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Place half of the eggplant on top of the bread, followed by another 1 to 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660130/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3529660130_8e0975a2f8.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add a second layer of bread.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848331/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/3528848331_671f247db1.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add the second half of the eggplant, and all of the remaining sauce.  Make sure that the bread is completely covered by sauce.  Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660212/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/3529660212_7915e068b1.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Place fresh tomato slices on the top of the lasagna, sprinkled with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848403/" title="Before baking by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2349/3528848403_1d24032941.jpg" width="450" alt="Before baking" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 40 minutes at 400º F.  Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660322/" title="After baking by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/3529660322_b299601825.jpg" width="450" alt="After baking" /></a></p>
<p>Top with basil leaves and drizzle sweet and thick balsamic vinegar (or balsamic syrup) on the plate if desired.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>I adore this recipe. </p>
<p>When I went vegan a little over five years ago, I had a minor panic attack when I realized I&#8217;d never eat another Cinnabon again.  I remember I used to ask my dad to bring them home from the airport for me when I was little, whenever he had a business trip.  The fluffy swirls of dough, the sugary syrup, the cream cheese frosting&#8230; I needed to recreate them perfectly, vegan style.  And let me tell you, these are a dead ringer for our mall and airport favorites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759744/" title="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3611/3511759744_850ede165d_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting" /></a>But it comes at a price.  If you&#8217;re looking for a healthy, low-fat, calorie conscious treat, I can&#8217;t help you today.  If you&#8217;re looking for a recipe that is guaranteed to win over any vegan doubter, guaranteed to please any Cinnabon lover, guaranteed to send any child into a permanent sugar high; these buns are for you.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of sugar and Earth Balance margarine in these.  But hey, the recipe makes a ton of rolls, and it takes four hours to make, so they&#8217;re really special occasion buns.  Embrace the cups (and cups) of sugar and fat, and you will definitely be rewarded with the most perfect cinnamon bun you&#8217;ve ever had.  Isn&#8217;t it worth it, at least once?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t yet overcome your apprehension about yeast breads, I encourage you to give these a try.  I&#8217;ve included tons of photos <em>and</em> a video to clarify the process and give you an idea how the dough is supposed to look at every step.  They might seem intimidating, but they&#8217;re easier than you think!  </p>
<p>I think these would be an amazing way to wake up Mom on Sunday, paired with a nice hot cup of coffee.  You can make these ahead of time, refrigerating over night before the second rise and popping them in the oven in the morning, or you can freeze them for later.  More info on that at the end of the recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Cinnamon Buns</strong><br />
<em>Makes 12 Large Buns</em></p>
<p><em>Yeast Mixture</em><br />
4 tsp Active Dry Yeast (a little less than 2 packets)<br />
1 tsp Sugar<br />
1 Cup Water, 110º F</p>
<p><em>Dough</em><br />
1 Cup Soymilk<br />
2/3 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
2 Ener-g Egg Replacer Eggs, prepared, optional<br />
Yeast Mixture, from above<br />
6 Cups All Purpose Flour, more for kneading</p>
<p><em>Dough Filling</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1 1/2 Cups Sugar<br />
3 Tbs Cinnamon</p>
<p><em>Pan Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1/3 Cup Sugar</p>
<p><em>Cream Cheese Frosting </em><br />
1/4 Cup Earth Balance<br />
1/3 Cup Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 Cup Powdered Sugar</p>
<p>Combine yeast mixture and set aside to proof.</p>
<p>From the dough ingredients, combine the soymilk, sugar, earth balance, salt, and ener-g eggs in a small sauce pan.  Heat until earth balance is melted and all the ingredients are well combined, but do not let the mixture get too hot.  You should be able to put a finger in it without burning yourself.</p>
<p>The yeast should now be nice and foamy (proofed).  Combine it with the warmed liquid you just made; make sure it&#8217;s not too hot, or you will kill your yeast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759002/" title="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3511759002_8da80553b5.jpg" width="450" alt="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients" /></a></p>
<p>Place 4 cups of all purpose flour in a large bowl.  Add the warmed wet ingredients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947095/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3510947095_18541808d4.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Beat the batter well with a wooden spoon.  The dough will be very wet and liquid, much more like a batter than a dough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947133/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3510947133_6f1c0e20c9.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Add 2 more cups of flour and mix in partially.  It&#8217;ll look like a wreck.  That&#8217;s fine!  Turn out the dough onto a large table/kneading surface, scraping out everything in the bowl.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759156/" title="Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3511759156_55f79e8e1b.jpg" width="450" alt="Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Begin kneading, gently at first.  It&#8217;s going to take about 8 minutes to get the dough where it needs to be.  Add more flour only if the dough starts sticking to the table and there is no more dry flour to be worked into the dough.  You want the dough to end up smooth and elastic, and slightly tacky, but not sticky.  You should be able to knead it on a bare table without it sticking.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the kneading and cutting process, so you can see the stages the dough goes through.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/4550120">Cinnamon Buns</a></p>
<p>Once the dough is ready, place it in an oiled bowl, covered with oiled plastic wrap, to rise for 90 minutes in a warm spot.  If you&#8217;re lacking a warm spot, turn your oven on low for 1 minute, then turn it off and place the dough in the oven to rise with the door closed.  Remember to turn the oven off after one minute, and remember the dough is in there &#8212; no preheating for other things! (I&#8217;ve made that mistake more than once, it&#8217;s never good.)</p>
<p>Once the dough has risen completely, it&#8217;ll leave a little dent when you poke it.  If it springs back, it needs more time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947303/" title="Risen Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3510947303_c2fc90c201.jpg" width="450" alt="Risen Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and press it down (this is part is in the video above).  You want it press or roll it out into a 15 x 20 inch rectangle.  You can use a roller if you want, but it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Pour the 1/2 cup of melted earth balance on the dough.  Brush it so the dough is covered completely.  It&#8217;s okay if it pools in some locations.</p>
<p>Mix together the cinnamon and sugar from the dough filling above.  Sprinkle it evenly over the dough. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947379/" title="Cinnamon Sugar Filling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/3510947379_2db606b531.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Sugar Filling" /></a></p>
<p>Prepare a large baking dish, like a lasagna dish, by pouring in the melted earth balance from the pan sauce ingredients above.  Brush the sides of the pan so they are greased.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947207/" title="Melted Earth Balance by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3510947207_9f6a344cb8.jpg" width="450" alt="Melted Earth Balance" /></a></p>
<p>Add the sugar, spreading evenly over the bottom of pan.  The pan is now ready for the buns.</p>
<p>The following steps are shown in detail in the video above:  Roll the dough up gently, starting from one of the short sides.  Let it rest on the seem once it&#8217;s rolled up completely.  Cut 12 rolls with dental floss or sewing thread.  Place the rolls in the pan.  (Ignore the fact that they are practically floating in earth balance and sugar.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947437/" title="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3510947437_0f43140f93.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked" /></a></p>
<p>Cover the buns and let rise for 45 minutes if you will be baking these immediately.  If baking the next day, cover the buns and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.  Bake in the morning with no need for more rising.  If making the buns for a date in the future, cover the buns and freeze immediately.  The day before you are ready to use them, defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then let warm up on the counter the next morning for an hour.  In any case, when ready to bake, follow the directions below.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350º F, remembering to remove the rising buns if they are in there!</p>
<p>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.  Let cool for a few minutes.  </p>

<p>Stir together the frosting ingredients.  It takes a bit of elbow grease to mix it together, but resist the urge to add liquid.  It will come together, I promise.  Whisk until there are no lumps.</p>
<p>Serve the buns warm with frosting.  I like to microwave completely cooled buns for 45-60 seconds before eating.</p>
<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day!</p>
