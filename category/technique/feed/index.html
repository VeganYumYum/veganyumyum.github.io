<p>Happy Spring, lovelies! </p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to break out of our winter food ruts, and I think I have just the thing.  Crêpes!  They&#8217;re light and can be filled with almost anything, but to get your imagination started I&#8217;ve created three recipes for you to try.</p>
<p>Now, vegan crepes.  They&#8217;re not hard once you get the hang of them.  The recipe I&#8217;m posting here comes from a veganized version of a standard &#8220;Eggless Crepe&#8221; recipe that&#8217;s floating around on the interwebs.  I just subbed soymilk and Earth Balance for milk and butter.  I also think it needs a little extra water, and I&#8217;ll point that out in the recipe below.  There is also a really good crêpe recipe in Veganomicon, if you have that cook book, but it calls for chickpea flour.  If you have your own favorite recipe, use that!  Whatever works for you will work here.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little video below to get you started if you&#8217;re new to crêpes.</p>
<p>The great thing about these is that you can make absolutely everything ahead.  They heat up in minutes, so it&#8217;s perfect if you&#8217;re cooking bunch or lunch for several people who all want different fillings.  Simply place the cold crêpe in the pan, put the fillings on top, heat through, and serve.  I make extra crêpes and keep them in the fridge for quick meals for the next day or two.</p>
<p>So, the fillings!</p>
<p><strong>Asparagus Hollandaise</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3382523191/" title="Asparagus Hollandaise Crêpe by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/3382523191_babee821f8.jpg" width="450" alt="Asparagus Hollandaise Crêpe" /></a></p>
<p>Asparagus season is here or will be shortly, and this creamy hollandaise-ish sauce is perfect with spring-tender stalks.  I just quickly pan-seared them so they&#8217;d have lots of flavor without overcooking them.  You can <a href="../../../2007/03/how-to-buy-and-prep-asparagus/index.html">check out my guide</a> to buying and prepping asparagus if you like.  The sauce has an almond base, so if you have good blender, you should be able to throw it together in minutes.  Nutritional yeast is optional, but it does give it a nice pale yellow color and as well as some flavor.  If you leave out the yeast, you might want to add a little turmeric for color.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom and Wilted Frisée</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3382523257/" title="Wild Mushroom and Wilted Frisée Crêpe by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3561/3382523257_041f5593cd.jpg" width="450" alt="Wild Mushroom and Wilted Frisée Crêpe" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sometimes-mushroom person.  Sometimes I love them, other times I eat around them.  I find the less-common mushrooms to be the tastiest.  I used king trumpet and chanterelle mushrooms in this crêpe, and man were they delicious.  Morels are coming in season, and they&#8217;d be wonderful, too.  You&#8217;re welcome to use more standard mushrooms if you want (cremini, portabello, button), but these fancier &#8216;shrooms were a real treat for me.  I paired them with some wilted frisée (also called curly endive or chicory).  It&#8217;s kind of bitter, but seems to mellow out with a quick sauté.  It matches the mushrooms perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Berry Crêpes</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3383339494/" title="Berry Crêpe au Sucre by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3383339494_4822507cda.jpg" width="450" alt="Berry Crêpe au Sucre" /></a></p>
<p>I really wanted to use strawberries in this one, but alas, it&#8217;s not quite the season for them yet.  The ones at my local store looked pretty sad.  The raspberries, on the other hand, looked perfect.  You can use any berry you like in these, along with a little sugar.  The sugar melts a bit, making this crazy-easy dessert really very tasty.  If you want, you can put a few tiny chunks of candied ginger in there as well.  You don&#8217;t need berries at all; my absolute favorite all-time crêpe is a simple crêpe au sucre.  Just sugar.  Pure and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Crêpes</strong><br />
<em>Makes 8-10</em></p>
<p>1/2 Cup Soymilk<br />
2/3 Cup Water<br />
1/4 Cup Earth Balance, melted<br />
1 Cup Flour<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 Tbs Sugar (sweet crepes only, optional)<br />
2 tsp Vanilla Extract (sweet crepes only, optional)<br />
2 Tbs Water, to thin if needed</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients in a blender or in a bowl.  Blend or whisk until smooth.  Transfer to a 2 Cup measuring cup (for pouring) and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  While the batter is refrigerating, prepare your fillings.</p>
<p><strong>Asparagus Hollandaise</strong><br />
<em>Fills 2-3 Crêpes</em></p>
<p>1/2 Lb Thin Asparagus, trimmed<br />
1 Tbs Earth Balance<br />
1 Pinch Salt<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p>Heat a large skillet (I used then cast-iron skillet for all of the fillings) over high heat.  Add Earth Balance and asparagus.  Cook for a few minutes, until asparagus are bright green, tender-crisp, and are browning in spots.  Add salt and pepper, set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3382523131/" title="Seared Asparagus by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3430/3382523131_420a99323a.jpg" width="450" alt="Seared Asparagus" /></a></p>
<p><em>Hollandaise Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Sliced Raw Almonds<br />
1/2 Cup Hot Water<br />
2 Tbs Earth Balance<br />
2 tsp Lemon Juice<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
2 Tbs Nutritional Yeast, optional (or 1/4 tsp turmeric for color)<br />
1/2 tsp Dijon Mustard, optional </p>
<p>Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until extremely smooth. </p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom and Wilted Frisée</strong><br />
<em>Fills 2-3 Crêpes</em></p>
<p>2 Tbs Earth Balance<br />
1 Cup Chopped Chanterelle Mushroms<br />
1 Cup Chopped Trumpet Mushrooms<br />
1/2 tsp Balsamic Vinegar<br />
Salt<br />
2 Sprig Fresh Rosemary, stem removed<br />
1 Cup Chopped Frisée Greens<br />
1-2 Cloves garlic, minced, optional</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3383339216/" title="Chanterelle and Trumpet Mushrooms by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3612/3383339216_515d41c6fb_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Chanterelle and Trumpet Mushrooms" /></a>Slice trumpet mushrooms lengthwise, then lengthwise again.  </p>
<p>Add the earth balance to a skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Add trumpet mushrooms and saute until beginning to brown.  Add chanterelles and rosemary.  Turn down heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with a pinch of salt and balsamic vinegar. Remove mushrooms from pan.</p>
<p>Add garlic and sweat until tender.  Add greens and cook until just wilted, one to two minutes.  Remove and set aside with mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3383339266/" title="Sauteed Chanterelle and Trumpet Mushrooms with Rosemary by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3444/3383339266_18788fdea4.jpg" width="450" alt="Sauteed Chanterelle and Trumpet Mushrooms with Rosemary" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Berry Crêpes</strong><br />
<em>Fills 2-3 Crêpes</em></p>
<p>1/2 Pint Raspberries (or other berries)<br />
Sugar</p>
<p>Berry crêpes are filled while the crêpes are still cooking.  Add sugar and berries to the crêpe as soon as it is flipped.  See below for more details about cooking the crêpes.</p>
<p><strong>Making Crêpes</strong></p>
<p>So now that you fillings are all prepared, and your crêpe batter has rested and chilled, we&#8217;re ready to make crêpes!  I&#8217;ve made a video that outlines the whole process, but here are a few things you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<p>-A non-stick omelet or crêpe pan<br />
-Cooking Spray<br />
-A graduated spatula (the long flat kind you use for frosting cakes), optional</p>
<p>If your batter is too thick when it comes out of the fridge, stir in 2 Tbs of water to loosen it up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3843098&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3843098&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/3843098">How to make Crepes</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/veganyumyum">lolo</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assembling and Serving</strong></p>
<p>So now you have a stack of cooling crêpes and fillings that have gone cold.  No worries.  You can keep your fillings in a warm oven until you&#8217;re ready to serve, or even easier, warm them up with the crêpes at the same time.  </p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to eat, place a crêpe back in a hot skillet (medium heat is fine) and add the fillings you want in the top.  Cover the whole thing and wait a few minutes.  You want everything to get hot, but you don&#8217;t want to cook the crêpe any more than it is.  When it&#8217;s hot, fold the crêpe in thirds and serve.  It should only take 1-2 minutes per crêpe to heat up, so you can make them to order for your friends and family.</p>
<p>Okay!  So are you ready to make crêpes?  I hope so, because typing the little circumflex is getting really annoying.  Making crêpes is much easier than accenting them correctly, I assure you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2313038126/" title="Wonton Soup by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2313038126_f4ae5879c9.jpg" alt="Wonton Soup" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a traditional wonton soup. I suppose a vegan wonton soup wouldn&#8217;t really be considered traditional anyway, but I really took some liberty with the recipe.  The wontons are stuffed with one of my favorite greens, Chinese broccoli, and chopped seitan.  I tossed the filling in a chili-mustard sauce for a salty, spicy kick.  The slight bitterness of the Chinese broccoli really balances the piquant heat of the dressing, creating a really yummy dumpling.</p>
<p>I wanted the wontons to be the star here, so I made a very light ginger-soy broth to float them in.  I only covered the wontons about half-way with the soup base, so really, this isn&#8217;t so much a soup as fresh dumplings lightly dressed with an aromatic broth.  In fact, the broth is quite plain on its own, but it works very nicely with the flavorful dumplings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2313021206/" title="Chinese Broccoli by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/2313021206_7c4d629e79_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Chinese Broccoli" height="160" width="240" /></a>Chinese broccoli is fantastic, and if you&#8217;ve never had it, I wholly recommend a search of your nearest Asian grocer to find some.  It&#8217;s a vegetable chimera of all of my favorite things; the florets of broccoli rabe, the stems of asparagus, and leaves like tender collard greens.  It has a mild flavor with a sweet and slightly bitter bite, and it&#8217;s perfect for stir-fries or any other hight heat/quick cooking method.   It&#8217;s also quite good for you, and its complex (but not overwhelming) flavor is a nice change of pace from regular broccoli or simple spinach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2312227257/" title="Wonton Soup by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3052/2312227257_ca006c92dd.jpg" alt="Wonton Soup" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Folding wontons isn&#8217;t hard, so as long as you can find the wonton skins, you&#8217;ll be good to go.  The brand I used here is called Twin Marquis, and I know they make both vegan and non-vegan wonton skins and gyoza wrappers.  Look for the white (not yellow) square wrappers.  The round ones are gyoza skins, much better for <a href="../../../2008/02/pot-stickers/index.html">pot stickers</a>; even though they&#8217;re similar, they&#8217;re a good deal thicker than the wonton skins.  Either way, check the label for eggs.</p>
<p>If you have leftover wonton skins, you can make extra wontons and freeze them in one layer on a cookie sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag for long-term storage.  Just drop them directly into boiling water when you&#8217;re ready to cook them.  You can also wrap the skins up tightly and store them in a fridge for a day or two.  Fill them with anything you like (spinach and tofutti cream cheese?  Tempeh sausage?), fold in half and seal shut.  Pan fry them in 1-2&#8243; of oil until cripsy and golden brown on both sides.  It&#8217;s a wonderfully tasty and quick appetizer or snack.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Broccoli Wontons in a Light Ginger-Soy Broth</strong><br />
<em> Serves Four</em></p>
<p>16 Wonton Skins</p>
<p><em>Filling</em><br />
1 Tbs Oil<br />
1-2 tsp Fresh Ginger, minced<br />
1 Cup Chinese Broccoli, thinly sliced<br />
3/4 Cup Seitan, chopped fine<br />
1/2 tsp Hot Chili Sauce, more if desired (like Sriracha)<br />
1 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1 tsp Tamari or Soy Sauce</p>
<p><em>Ginger-Soy Broth</em><br />
4 Cups Water<br />
5-6 Fresh Ginger Slices<br />
1 Tbs Mirin<br />
2 Tbs Tamari (or soy sauce)<br />
1 1/2 tsp Sugar<br />
2 tsp Rice Vinegar<br />
1/2 tsp Salt, plus more to taste<br />
1/4 Cup Chinese Broccoli Leaves, packed (sub: spinach or collards)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2312214171/" title="Chopped Chinese Broccoli by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2312214171_a86ebda9ec_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Chopped Chinese Broccoli" height="160" width="240" /></a><strong>Filling:</strong> Begin by chopping the Chinese broccoli very thinly with a sharp knife, from the base of the stem up towards the leaves (just like chopping scallions).  Heat a large pan with oil and add the ginger.  Once the ginger becomes fragrant, add the broccoli and seitan, stirring well and cooking until the broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp.</p>
<p>Transfer the broccoli-seitan mixture to a small bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients.  Taste and adjust to your liking.  Set aside while you make the broth.</p>
<p><strong>Broth:</strong>  Heat all of the broth ingredients together except the greens in a small sauce pan, until sugar and salt is dissolved and the ginger has had time to infuse into the broth.  Taste and add more salt if desired, but remember this is a mild broth that is only meant to be a complement to the wontons.  Once the broth has begin to simmer, turn off heat and toss in greens.  Cover and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2312217005/" title="Folding Wontons by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2312217005_103fe11b9f.jpg" alt="Folding Wontons" width="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Fill the wontons:</strong> Place 1-2 tsp of filling in the center of the wonton.  Wet the edges of the wrapper with water (a finger dipped in water works great) and seal into a trianlge, removing as much air as possible from the dumpling.  Make sure edges are secured.</p>
<p>Set the triangle in front of you, pointing up.  Wet one of the bottom corners.  Hold the corners, one between each thumb and forefinger.  Begin to bend the wrapper, as if you were forcing it into a horseshoe shape.  Don&#8217;t change your grip, and resist the urge to fold the corners over.  Bring the two ends together, crossing them slightly, and press to seal.  Going from the triangle shape to a completed wonton is one fluid motion.</p>
<p>Your dumpling should look like a fun little fish-boat-hat.  Like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2313027752/" title="Prepped Wontons by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/2313027752_90327124bb.jpg" alt="Prepped Wontons" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>You can now freeze your dumplings, or cook them right away.</p>
<p><strong>To prepare the soup:</strong>  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Re-heat your broth to steaming, if necessary.  Gently lower the wontons into the boiling water and cook until they become translucent, about 2-3 minutes if the wontons aren&#8217;t frozen, longer if they are.  Remove them from the water with a spider (or other slotted spoon device) and place them into the hot broth.</p>
<p>Take care to remove and discard any dumplings that have opened up during cooking.  If they open, water gets inside, washes all the flavor away, and you&#8217;ll be sad if you serve it or eat it.  It will taste like watery mush, and I promise you won&#8217;t be happy about it.</p>
<p>Ladle 3-4 wontons into a bowl and add a small amount of broth, enough to half-way cover the wontons.  Make sure to get some greens in there, too.  Serve immediately.</p>

<p>There ain&#8217;t no shame in a cheeseless pizza.  But I didn&#8217;t know that until I started eating them.</p>
<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and it seemed every little strip mall (of which there were many) had it&#8217;s own independently-owned pizza place.  They all made different styles of pizza, and they were all <i>really</i> freaking good.  When we ordered pizza, we didn&#8217;t have to choose between huge pizza chain restaurants&#8211;none of them ever made pizza I really loved, anyway&#8211;we could pick a from several small owner-operated places.  The pizza place nearest to my house was always everyone&#8217;s favorite.  Lucky me!  I&#8217;ve been trying to recreate their crust for a while now.  Today was the closest I&#8217;ve ever come.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that I post a recipe that isn&#8217;t either totally made up by me, or at least heavily adapted.  This recipe, however, is straight from <A href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/">101cookbooks.com</a>, and I can&#8217;t thank Heidi Swanson  enough for taking the time to adapt and post this wonderful dough recipe to her website.  She got the recipe from <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580082688/heidiswanson-20">The Bread Baker&#8217;s Apprentice</a>, a book that I&#8217;ve heard nothing but glowing reviews of.  I&#8217;m about to buy a copy of it for myself.  She&#8217;s whittled the many-page recipe down to the basics, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m sharing with you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been searching for a crust: thin but not too thin, tender but not doughy or bready, crispy but not cracker-ish.  Sometimes you needn&#8217;t look hard nor long to get the what you&#8217;re looking for.  I typed in &#8220;best pizza dough&#8221; into google, and wham!  The first result was Heidi&#8217;s page.  I read it over, thinking that surely the first result wouldn&#8217;t be what I needed, but soon I was convinced that this was serious pizza dough.  Even if it didn&#8217;t replicate what I was looking for, it&#8217;d still be damn good.</p>
<p>And it didn&#8217;t let me down.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m going to re-post the recipe that Heidi posted on her blog, I have my own write-up, step-by-step photos, and tips below.  But I do encourage you to take a look at <A href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001199.html">what Heidi has to say</a> as well, and if you&#8217;re really interested in <i>all</i> the details, pick yourself up a copy of <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580082688/heidiswanson-20">The Bread Baker&#8217;s Apprentice</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few things you need to know about this pizza dough: it needs to be prepared a day in advance, it makes enough for 6 pizza crusts, it preforms best on a pizza stone, and it&#8217;s not hard if you follow the directions carefully.</p>
<p>The dough does a slow rise/ferment overnight which gives it not only a lovely flavor, but an unbeatable texture.  It&#8217;s a process you just can&#8217;t rush.  The good news is that you end up making enough dough for six pizzas, and it can be frozen easily (directions below).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to urge you, just like Heidi does, to pick up a pizza stone.  (If you&#8217;re really feeling fancy, get a pizza peel, too.)  Pizza stones are great for all sorts of things.  They cook frozen or fresh pizza perfectly, they&#8217;re great for flatbreads, and for re-heating food.  Since they absorb and radiate heat, they also help even out hot and cold spots in your oven; just leave the sucker on the bottom of your oven all the time and everything will cook and bake more evenly.  I picked up a wooden peel, too, because my local kitchen store was having a sale.  I got the soapstone pizza stone and wooden peel for $25.  Now I can not only make really good pizza, but feel really cool doing it at the same time.  Surely that&#8217;s worth a one-time $25 investment!</p>
<p><strong>Peter Reinhart&#8217;s Napoletana Pizza Dough</strong><br />
<em>For six 6 oz Pizza Crusts</em></p>
<p>4 1/2 Cups (20.25 ounces) Unbleached High-Gluten, Bread, or All-Purpose Flour, chilled<br />
1 3/4 (.44 ounce) tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp (.11 ounce) Instant Yeast<br />
1/4 Cup (2 ounces) Olive Oil (optional, I include it)<br />
1 3/4 Cups (14 ounces) Water, ice cold (40Â°F)<br />
Semolina Flour or Cornmeal, for dusting</p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine all the above ingredients.  Mix well with your hands until all the flour is absorbed and a sticky, wet dough has formed.  At this point, decide if you&#8217;re going to knead by hand or with a stand mixer.  While I love kneading by hand, I used a stand mixer.  This dough is <i>very</i> soft and sticky, and I don&#8217;t use my kitchenaid enough.</p>
<p><b>By Hand</b><br />
Dip a metal spoon in cold water and beat the dough with it, re-cooling the spoon as you go.  While beating the dough, spin the bowl in the opposite direction with your free hand.  Reverse the spin every-so-often.  &#8220;Knead&#8221; the dough in this fashion for 5-7 minutes, until a smooth but still very sticky mass has formed.</p>
<p><b>Stand Mixer &#8211; My preferred method</b><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143683999/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/2143683999_f49a00d06f_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a>Using the dough hook, beat the dough for 5-7 minutes on a medium speed, or until a smooth, sticky mass has formed.  While the dough is being kneaded, it should look like a tornado; it should clear the sides of the bowl, but still be attached to the bottom of it, forming a dough tornado up the dough hook.  If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, add flour, little by little, until the sides release.  If the dough isn&#8217;t sticking to the bottom of the bowl, add water, little by little, until it does.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144479270/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2273/2144479270_c9164ec77c.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143692305/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2052/2143692305_64c59961c6.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>With a wet chef&#8217;s knife, cut the dough into 6 equal hunks.  Each hunk should weigh 6 oz, if you&#8217;re anal like that.  Generously dust the dough with flour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143696867/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2160/2143696867_0b057125e2.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Flour your hands well and gently shape each hunk into a sphere.  If the dough is sticking to you or anything else, use more flour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144494950/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2167/2144494950_136a8836e2.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, prepare any dough you want to freeze for later.  In a small bowl, add a few tablespoons of olive oil.  Roll the dough ball in the oil and place in a freezer bag &#8211; one ball per bag.  Freeze immediately for up to three months.  The day before you want to make pizza from the frozen dough, remove it from the freezer and into the refrigerator to defrost overnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144498314/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2153/2144498314_a6f4b1912a.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>The dough you&#8217;re going to use within in the next three days should be placed on parchment paper, covered in oil, and wrapped with plastic wrap.  Let dough rest in the refrigerator overnight, or for up to three days.</p>
<p><b>Through the magic of the internet, time passes immediately</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144500626/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2144500626_ebcee85b16.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Two hours before making the pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit on the counter at room temperature.  45 minutes before making the pizza, pre-heat the oven with the pizza stone in the bottom (or on the lowest rack) to 450-500Âº F.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143711379/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2232/2143711379_a755a7d3e5.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Press dough, still on the parchment paper, into a disc.  Remove the plastic wrap and dust liberally with flour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143720283/" title="Pizza Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2413/2143720283_97b1673f46.jpg" width="450" alt="Pizza Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Gently press the dough out, enlarging it into 9&#8243; &#8211; 12&#8243; in diameter.  My dough was really soft, so pressing sufficed.  If your dough is firmer, you can try picking it up and spreading it over your knuckles, or just using a rolling pin.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144514144/" title="Flipping your uncooked dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2203/2144514144_3fc736d401.jpg" width="450" alt="Flipping your uncooked dough" /></a></p>
<p>Now for a fun trick.  I&#8217;ve always had trouble getting soft, uncooked pizza dough onto a peel (or the back of a cookie sheet) and into the oven without destroying the pizza.  Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve learned to do it successfully.  Dust the top of the dough (which will soon be the bottom) with cornmeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2144516760/" title="Flipping your uncooked dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2250/2144516760_3a92c53e8e.jpg" width="450" alt="Flipping your uncooked dough" /></a></p>
<p>Place the peel over the top of the dough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2143726579/" title="Flipping your uncooked dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/2143726579_a7a79bd0c2.jpg" width="450" alt="Flipping your uncooked dough" /></a></p>
<p>Flip the dough over, so the bottom of the dough that was coated in cornmeal is now laying on the peel.  Give the peel a little shake, the dough should slide freely!  If it does, you&#8217;re in luck.</p>
<p>Top your pizza mosdestly &#8211; 3-4 toppings including sauce!  We like to top our pizzas with tomato sauce, sundried tomatoes, pineapple chunks, and pine nuts.</p>
<p>Check to be sure your pizza still slides easily on your peel.  If it does, gently slide the pizza off the peel onto the hot stone with small but firm jerks of your arm.  Bake at 450Âº for 5-8 minutes, until crust is lightly browned around the edges.</p>
<p>Top with freshly chopped herbs and a drizzle of olive oil.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>Stewart and I went apple picking a couple weeks ago, and in the little farm store we saw pumpkin whoopie pies.  Stewart asked if I would make them, and when I said yes, he bought a sugar pumpkin to increase the chances of me keeping my promise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that these aren&#8217;t perfect.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, they&#8217;re really <em>really </em>tasty, but the verdict is that they&#8217;re not exactly like traditional whoopie pies.  I need to work on the batter recipe, because these are more like soft cookie pies than whoopie pies.  I think with an even softer, spongier batter, we&#8217;ll be in business, but these are perfectly serviceable cookie-whoopie pies if you want to give the initial test recipe a shot.</p>
<p>I used homemade pumpkin puree, but the canned stuff will work fine.  The homemade version is easy, but obviously more time consuming than opening up a can.  As far as I can tell, the only difference between the canned puree and the homemade is the color.  Homemade pumpkin puree is considerably lighter and brighter.  I&#8217;ll include the preparation for the puree at the end of the post.</p>
<p><strong>Pumpkin Whoopie Pies</strong><br />
<em>Makes 18-24 Small Pies (36-48 pieces)</em></p>
<p>1/2 Cup Non Hydrogenated Vegetable Shortening<br />
2 Cups Sugar<br />
2 tsp Molasses<br />
2 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 1/2 Cups Pumpkin Puree<br />
4 1/2 Cups All Purpose Flour<br />
1 Tbs Ener-G Egg Replacer<br />
1 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Nutmeg<br />
1/4 tsp Allspice<br />
1/4 tsp Cinnamon </p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375Âº.  Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Cream shortening and sugar together, using a stand mixer if available.  You can also do it by hand.  Add molasses and vanilla and beat well.  Add pumpkin puree and whip until incorporated (don&#8217;t worry if the fat doesn&#8217;t mix in completely).</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Add this dry mix to the wet until all incorporated.  It will make a stiff batter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1763637877/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/1763637877_e1c989601d.jpg" width="450" alt="Pumpkin Batter" /></a></p>
<p>I find it easiest to use and ice cream scoop that has a release lever to drop the dough onto your cookie sheet.  The scoop I used holds 2 Tbs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1764500106/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/1764500106_eb0278bf65.jpg" width="450" alt="Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, shaping" /></a></p>
<p>Wet your fingers and gently flatten the dough balls.  This will prevent your pies from tipping over by creating a semi-flat surface for them to rest on.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1764518010/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/1764518010_67596863bf.jpg" width="450" alt="Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, shaping" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 10-13 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, and the tops spring back when pressed in the center.</p>
<p>Remove cookies from the cookie sheet as soon as they come out of the oven to prevent over-baking.  Cover them with a towel or plastic wrap to keep moisture/steam in, as this will prevent a hard crust from forming. Prepare the filling while your cookies are cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Cream Cheese Filling</strong></p>
<p>1/2 Container Tofutti Better than Cream Cheese<br />
2 Cups Powdered Sugar<br />
2 Tbs Earth Balance</p>
<p>Whip ingredients together until smooth.  Set aside or refrigerate until use.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1764571696/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2212/1764571696_deea9a945d_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Pumpkin Whoopie Pies  with Cream Cheese Filling" /></a>I put my filling in a zip-top bag and sliced off the corner to pipe the filling into the center.  You don&#8217;t need that much filling per pie.  Make sure the sides of the cookies that were touching the cookie sheet are the side that touch the filling.</p>
<p>Traditional whoopie pies are chocolate.  I think these would be awesome with some mini chocolate chips mixed in, or perhaps some melted chocolate drizzled over the top.  Store them wrapped in plastic wrap or in an air-tight container to keep them soft.</p>

<span id="more-213"></span></p>
<p><strong>Homemade Pumpkin Puree</strong><br />
<em>Makes 3-4 Cups</em></p>
<p>1 Sugar Pumpkin, 3-4 pounds<br />
1-2 Cups Water</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400Âº F.</p>
<p>Slice pumpkin in half.  Scoop out the seeds and strings&#8211;if you&#8217;d like to save the seeds, place the seedy pulp large bowl and set aside, otherwise discard it.  Place pumpkin cut-side-down on a rimed cookie sheet or inside a large roasting pan.  Add 1-2 Cups of water and bake for 90 minutes, or until flesh is very soft and the skin has darkened.  Scoop out the soft flesh into the work bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Tip for Seeds</strong><br />
Place the pulp and seeds in a large bowl and cover with a generous amount of water.  Squeeze the pulp to separate it from the seeds.  The seeds will float.  Use a slotted spoon to skim the seeds from the top of the water.  Dry the seeds well and roast and season if desired.</p>

<p>I saw this cake on <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2007/08/peach-upside-down-cake.html">FatFree Vegan Kitchen</a> a few days ago, and I was devastated.  I had, the night before, sat down and eaten every peach I had because they were all ripe and I hadn&#8217;t come up with a plan for them fast enough.  Peaches and pears, the most elusively ripening fruits in the universe!  &#8220;Not yet not yet not yet not yet not yet NOW!  Too late!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075138256/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1122/1075138256_8d8296e4ba_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Summer Peaches" /></a>So I sliced them all up, divided them between two bowls and my husband and I ate them in one sitting.  Now, it&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t enjoy them just as they were, unblemished, sweet and juicy.  But when I read Susan&#8217;s post the next day, my heart sank.  I wanted that cake!  I wanted it right then!</p>
<p>Thankfully few days later I got another round of peaches from our CSA.  And then a miracle happened &#8211; the ripened to perfection on the coolest day we&#8217;ve had in a long while.  Why, it was downright chilly today!  I could <i>actually</i> use the oven!  The gods of ripened fruit had smiled upon me, and I was going to have my cake!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1074337245/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1138/1074337245_55373b5127_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Peach Upside-Down Cake" /></a>This sounds like the set up for bad news, but I assure you, there is no bad news.  The cake is delicious.  And the recipe is easy.  I made it as Susan wrote it (with the optional added sugar, because I apparently am just begging for adult onset diabetes) and it worked out great!  I think next time I will add some dollops of earth balance over the peaches to balance the sugary glaze with a savory note, but I&#8217;m seriously nit-picking here.  This is a gem of a cake.  You need to make it!</p>
<p>I discovered last week, however, that peeling a ripe peach can be a messy process.  The darn things are downright unforgiving if you mishandle them.  They will turn to mush in your hands, leaving you with a pile of glop roughly assembled around a pit.  Granted, it&#8217;s a tasty pile of glop, but it&#8217;s glop nevertheless.</p>
<p>I know everyone says blanching peaches is the way to go.  The skins come right off and all is well in the world.  But I don&#8217;t want to blanch my peaches!  I apparently cannot be troubled to boil water.  It is a pain in the butt, right?  For peaches?  I don&#8217;t want to cook them, I want to <i>eat</i> them.  Below is a tutorial for those of you who desire pretty peach slices without blanching.  Now you have no excuse not to make Susan&#8217;s cake!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1074324181/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1248/1074324181_e08156caea_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 1" /></a>Begin by using a small, sharp paring knife to cut along the peach&#8217;s natural divide.  Insert the knife until you feel the pit, then move the peach around the knife (not the other way around!) until you have a clean cut dividing the peach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075165764/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1051/1075165764_d7a819762e_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 2" /></a>Place your thumbs were the stem of the peach was and gently pry the two halves apart.  If your peach is overripe, you may have some trouble here, as the force you need to use will crush the peach before it separates it.  Take your time if this happens, but just ripe peaches will separate fine</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075176854/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1051/1075176854_93cba64cfa_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 3" /></a>Now you have the two halves, one side containing the pit.  This isn&#8217;t really a step, I just like adding in photos for no reason, apparently.  Sometimes you can pry the pit out with your fingers at this step, but some peaches won&#8217;t let you win that easy.  You might need loosen it a little more before you try, as shown in the next step.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075251742/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/1075251742_bc97a737a4_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 4" /></a>Cut the pit-side in half, running your knife up along the pit.  With really ripe peaches, you need to be careful even holding them.  I definitely have accidently made thumb prints in the sides of what was otherwise a totally unblemished peach simply because I grasped it too roughly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1074401531/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1294/1074401531_e1c962666a_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 5" /></a>Now you should be able to pry these to halves apart.  Again, be gentle.  </p>
<p>You&#8217;re almost done.  Try separating it from the other end if it begins to get mushy on you.  Also, don&#8217;t lick the peach juice off your hands in front of guests!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075219262/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1097/1075219262_b860dcd1e1_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 6" /></a>Remove the pit and toss it.  Or, you know, don&#8217;t toss it.  Collect them and <a href="http://www.universalpreschool.com/how-to/fruit_pit_math.asp">play games with them</a>.  The more adventurous among you can <a href="http://www.cst.cmich.edu/users/dietr1rv/peachpits/index.htm">carve them into the likeness of Abe Lincoln</a>.  I&#8217;m not kidding.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind a peach pit ring.  I&#8217;m a size 5.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1074294275/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1057/1074294275_35f3675a72_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 7" /></a>Now cut the peach pieces you have so you have eight even slices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1075146066/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1101/1075146066_d4ebec4486_m.jpg"  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="How to Make Nice Peach Slices, 8" /></a>The slices will be small enough that you can easily peel the skin off with your fingers.  I&#8217;ve tried peeling the skin from larger slices, and it just doesn&#8217;t work.  </p>
<p>Now all you have to do is make that cake!</p>

<p>Welcome to asparagus season!  Are you as excited as I am?</p>
<p>Asparagus is a lovely vegetable, but much like <a href="../../../2007/02/how-to-buy-and-prep-brussels-sprouts/index.html">brussels sprouts</a>, it is a vegetable much abused. And also like sprouts, you can start off on the wrong foot even before you get then back to your kitchen.</p>
<p>We all look for ripe berries, unbruised apples, and juicy tomatoes.  So don&#8217;t buy just <em>any</em> bunch of asparagus you see at the store.  You want to look for a few key qualities:</p>
<p>1. Very thin to fairly thin in diameter<br />
2. Tight, compact heads<br />
3. Firm, unwrinkled stalks</p>
<p>Any time a bunch of asparagus fails to meet one of these requirements, it&#8217;s a sign that the asparagus is old in one way or another.  If you find thick asparagus, it was harvested too late and will be bitter, stringy, and even woody.  If the head is loose and spindly &#8211; same deal.  If the stalks are wrinkly and collapsing, they&#8217;ve been on the shelf too long and are starting to decompose.  Run away!  Run very far away.  I hear string beans are nice!</p>
<p>I bet you&#8217;re wondering how thick is too thick.  My ideal asparagus is the same thickness as a pencil, but these aren&#8217;t always available.  The same thickness as a regualr Sharpie marker is definitely acceptable.  Once you get into magic marker range, or the diameter of an American dime, you&#8217;ve gone too far.  Pencils and Sharpies.  That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re shooting for.  I have a contingency plan for maybe-too-thick asparagus, but more on that later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435691748/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/435691748_b51b5ca9e4_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Storing Asparagus" height="240" width="160" /></a>Unless you&#8217;re going to eat them immediately after you get home, you&#8217;re going to need to store your asparagus.  You should treat your asparagus like a bouquet of flowers.  Chop 1/2 inch off the ends and place the entire bunch in a glass with a little water in the bottom.  Take a quart-sized ziplock and invert it over the top and store in the fridge.  Your asparagus will stay fresher longer.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to use the asparagus, you need to go through at least one more step, but it&#8217;s fun because it involves mystical asparagus magic.  The head of the asparagus is the most tender, and as the stalk gets thicker, it gets tougher.  There is a magic point somewhere between the tip and the end of the asparagus that separates tasty-tender from icky-tough.  You may not know where this point is, but your asparagus does.  Observe:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435692308/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/435692308_94fab762c9.jpg" alt="Trimming Asparagus" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Hold your asparagus with both hands, about two inches from the tip and the end.  You can chant softly if you want.  Gently bend the asparagus&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435692910/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/435692910_4dbebce922.jpg" alt="Trimming Asparagus" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;until it snaps.  You have reached asparagus enlightenment.  You see, it will naturally break at a point of resistance, and that point is where the stem is too tough to be enjoyable.  Do this for all your asparagus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435695002/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/435695002_332baab0fd_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Peeled Asparagus" height="160" width="240" /></a>If you bought asparagus that may be a little too thick, or you feel like being super fancy, you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435695229/">peel your asparagus</a>.  It&#8217;ll take some of the stringy-ness away, but I&#8217;ve seen fancy restaurants do this even with perfectly thin asparagus.  Use a vegetable peeler and peel from tip to stem, being careful not to pass over the same spot twice.  You can end up with pretty sad looking asparagus if you peel them too much.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to cook.  How?  There are a bunch of ways.  You can grill, saute, roast, boil, or steam, to name a few.  Steaming is one of the more popular ways, but I prefer to boil mine in a shallow pan of water.  Asparagus can go from DONE!  to WHOA! OVERDONE! fairly quickly, so I like to be able to see it and poke it as much as I want when I&#8217;m cooking it &#8211; it&#8217;s harder to do that in my all-metal steamer.  And to be fair, my mother also cooked asparagus in a pan of shallow water, so I&#8217;m not surprised that it&#8217;s my default method.  Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
<p>Below is a simple recipe for asparagus, but there are really so many tasty ways to enjoy this vegetable.  If you need a place to start, this is a good one, but definitely explore other ways of cooking it.  Roasting and grilling especially.  Yum.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Balsamic Asparagus</strong><br />
<em>Makes four small side servings</em></p>
<p>1 Bunch (1 lb) Asparagus, prepped (detailed above)<br />
1 pinch salt<br />
1 Tbs Earth Balance or Olive Oil<br />
1/2 tsp Balsamic Vinegar</p>
<p>Heat 1/2 inch of water in a large skillet.  When it starts to simmer, add asparagus.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435695684/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/435695684_bfce9e682a.jpg" alt="Asparagus in Simmering Water" width="400" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/435696240/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/179/435696240_d117445da2.jpg" alt="Asparagus, green" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>When the asparagus turns bright green (see second photo of the two above), drain off all the water, keeping asparagus in the pan.  Add earth balance and pinch of salt.  Toss to coat.  Add vinegar and toss to coat.  Serve immediately with a generous amount of black pepper.  Asparagus should be tender but still slightly crunchy.</p>

<p>I did this to my unsuspecting pepper on purpose.  You should do it too.</p>
<p>Roasting a pepper is easy-peasy if you have a gas stove like me.  You can also do it in an oven if you don&#8217;t, and instructions for that will be at the bottom of this entry.  If you do have a gas stove, the instructions are pretty much &#8220;burn the crap out of the pepper, scrape the gross stuff off, eat.&#8221;  Want a few more details?</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906494/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/425906494_958afefb13_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Roasting a Pepper" height="160" width="240" /></a> 1. Put the pepper directly over a high flame.  Have some tongs ready.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906510/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/425906510_3cdee64da4_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" alt="Roasting a Pepper" height="160" width="240" /></a> 2.  Watch as it starts to char a little.  This is good!  And fun.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906534/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/146/425906534_823c0fe9a4_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" alt="Roasting a Pepper" height="160" width="240" /></a>3. Turn the pepper with the tongs as the skin blackens.  Don&#8217;t grab the pepper by its stem, tempting as it is, because it may break off as the pepper gets tender.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906568/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/425906568_28fe424b7b_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Roasting a Pepper" height="240" width="160" /></a>4.  Don&#8217;t forget the bottom.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906607/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/425906607_4968c3d880_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Fire Roasted Pepepr" height="174" width="240" /></a>5.  Make sure every part is charred, but don&#8217;t go too crazy.  This is as roasted as you can get before actually burning the flesh inside.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/425906627/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/187/425906627_ae6386b81e_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Fire Roasted Pepper in Foil" height="240" width="160" /></a>6.  Wrap in foil and let sit for 15 minutes until cool enough to handle.  The steam created in the foil helps the skin slip off easier, so don&#8217;t skip this step!  You can also put it in a ziplock</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/426086698/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/178/426086698_fc545c49fb_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Roasted Pepper" height="160" width="240" /></a>7.  Use a knife to cut a circle around the the stem.  Pull on the stem to remove the seeds.  If the pepper is still piping hot at this point, steam will shoot out and burn you!</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/426086736/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/426086736_fcd0a14c62_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Roasted Pepper, removing skin" /></a>8.  Pour out water that has settled inside the pepper.  Use your fingers to slip the skin off.  Resist the urge to run it under water.  I know it&#8217;s messy this way, but it&#8217;ll taste better if you simply rub the pepper with your fingers or a paper towel to remove the skin &#8211; you want to keep the juices and even a few flecks of char for flavor!</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/426086759/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/426086759_b8bbccc378_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Roasted Pepper Slices" height="160" width="240" /></a>9.  Slice the pepper into four slabs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing this in an oven, turn your oven on broil.  Brush peppers lightly with a high-heat oil and place under the broiler, watching for the skin to blacken.  Turn peppers until fully roasted and then follow instructions from step 6 on.</p>
<p>So what now?  Eat it!  Roasted peppers are delicious on sandwiches, blended into hummus, tossed onto pizzas, added to soups, mixed into salads, stirred into pasta sauce&#8230;  I usually roast sweet bell peppers but the spicy ones can also be prepared this way.  Go nuts.  Eat peppers.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the second <a href="http://www.theppk.com/">PPK</a> potluck, and this time the theme is orange &#8211; flavor or color.  I decided to make mini samosas with mango chutney.  If a little chutney is good, certainly a lot of chutney is better.  I&#8217;ve been reading up on home canning recently and decided a high-acid food like mango chutney would be a great introduction to preserving food.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/423361640/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/157/423361640_a994c6554d_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Home Canning Casualty" height="160" width="240" /></a>I now have 8 half-pint jars of homemade chutney ready to go, but I fear the samosas will need to be prepared by my husband Stewart.  When canning, you should really use the proper equipment.  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=jar%20lifters&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Jar lifters</a> are indispensable.  I decided that tongs and a <a href="http://www.surlatable.com/product/silicone+mini+oven+mitts.do?search=basic&keyword=silicone&sortby=shortdesc&asc=true&page=all">oven mit</a> would be <em>just fine</em> until I got a jar lifter.  Oh, how wrong I was!  The jar slipped from the tongs and splashed boiling water inside my heat-proof water-proof mit, burning me thoroughly.  If you&#8217;re going to try home canning, please spend the $5 for a jar lifter.  Please.</p>

I&#8217;ll post a full write up on it once I&#8217;m able to complete the process with properly fuctioning limbs.  The photo to the left shows my chutney processing in a <em>boiling water bath</em>, which does double duty killing any unwatned bacteria and forming a vacuum seal.  Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be able to check to make sure my seals are tight, but until then they sit undisturbed in the kitchen.</p>
<p>This chutney, as long as the seals test okay, will keep for at least a year.  How exciting!  I can&#8217;t wait to try more home caning (after my hand heals, of course.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I&#8217;ll have a full update on the Boston Orange themed potluck, pictures and all.  I hear there will be cake and pies galore, root beer floats and even orange pizza.  I&#8217;m very excited.  If my hand is up to it, I might even make some donuts.</p>

<p>There really isn&#8217;t a <em>wrong</em> way to cut a pepper, but this way makes it easy to deal with the seeds and the ribs. This method isn&#8217;t going to work for you if you want pepper rings, but it&#8217;s great for all other types of cuts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314235/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/421314235_ffa7ee12bf_m.jpg" alt="Orange Bell Pepper" height="240" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>Start by cutting a circle around the top of the pepper, following the top edge all the way around.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314238/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/168/421314238_fdcb48eced.jpg" alt="Orange Bell Pepper" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Pull the top off by the stem and discard the it.  There might be a few seeds left inside the pepper, but the majority of them should be on the top.  Look at the inside of your pepper.  See the white-ish ribs?  That&#8217;s where you want to make your cuts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314249/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/421314249_a33dd964b5.jpg" alt="Orange Bell Pepper" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Slice down the middle of one of those ribs, making sure the point of your knife lands on the bottom-center of the pepper.  Continue slicing down each rib, having each slice end at the same point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314310/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/421314310_b3341916b4.jpg" alt="Orange Bell Pepper" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Your pepper should be in 3-4 pieces now (depending on how many ribs it had), and the edge of each piece should have part of a white rib on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314336/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/178/421314336_22d7465cc2.jpg" alt="Orange Bell Pepper" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Begin slicing off the ribs from the edges of each piece, starting at the top and slicing in a U-shape all the way around until the rib has been removed.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/421314323/in/photostream/">Here</a> is another view.  See the piece next to the pepper I&#8217;m cutting the rib off of?  That&#8217;s the finished result.</p>
<p>Had you not sliced down each rib, the ribs would have been in the middle of your pieces instead of at the edges.  Since a pepper is curved, it can be had to remove the ribs if they&#8217;re in the middle of the pieces.  Obviously it&#8217;s not a tragedy if this happens, but since it takes no more effort or time to cut them this way, why not do it?</p>
<p>You should now have 3-4 seed-free, rib-free pepper pieces perfect for slicing into strips, chunks, whatever shape you want.</p>
