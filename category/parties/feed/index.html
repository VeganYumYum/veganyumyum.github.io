			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326722/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8004326722_19c173aeff_b.jpg" width="1000" height="702" alt="Curried Chips with Lemon Sunflower Spread"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick little snack I whipped up today to use up bagels and pita bread I (stupidly) bought before going out of town. Bagel and pita chips are really easy to make, and you can spice them however you like.  </p>
<p>I also bought some roasted sunflower seeds, but had a hard time imagining how I could make it through 1 1/2 cups of them before they went bad. Clearly I&#8217;m not the most practical shopper.</p>
<p>I used garam masala to flavor my chips, but you should treat any spices (and especially, any ground spice mixes you have) as fair game for this recipe. Smoked paprika? Old Bay? Japanese seven spice? Celery salt? So many possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004327064/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8004327064_28f427fdd5_b.jpg" width="1000" height="675" alt="Fresh Lemon Juice"></a></p>
<p>The sunflower dip has fresh lemon, ground white pepper, and a dash of tabasco. Here again is a lovely blank canvas for you to experiment with. If I had it available I would have added some freshly chopped mint. Roasted garlic or fresh scallions would make a lovely addition as well, for people who are normal and like those sorts of things (i.e. not me).</p>
<p>The dip is really rich and reminds me a lot of tahini (sesame seed paste) but without the bitter taste. If you want an even more pronounced lemon flavor, add the zest.  This dip can also be thinned out to form a dressing, used as a sandwich spread, or as stand in for hummus.</p>
<p><strong>Curried Chips with Lemon Sunflower Spread</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 1 cup of spread and 4 cups of chips</em></p>
<p><em>For the Chips</em><br />
1 Bagel<br />
2 Pita Bread Rounds<br />
2 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
1/2 &#8211; 1 tsp Garam Masala, or other spice mix<br />
Salt</p>
<p><em>For the Spread</em><br />
1 Cup Roasted, Salted Sunflower Seeds (shelled)<br />
1 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
Zest of 1 lemon, optional<br />
1/4 to 1/3 Cup of Lemon Juice (2-3 lemons)<br />
1 Cup Water<br />
1/4 &#8211; 1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Tabasco, more if desired<br />
White Pepper<br />
Fresh Herbs (optional, such as mint, scallions)</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326051/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/8004326051_b33855771b_b.jpg" width="1000" height="652" alt="Sliced Bagel"></a></p>
<p>Slice your bagel into thin slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Slice the pita bread rounds in half.  Stack the halves and slice into 1 inch strips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004327210/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/8004327210_4d8f23cc0f_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Spicing the Chips"></a></p>
<p>Place all the bread into a large bowl and toss well with 2 Tbs of olive oil and garam masala.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004325905/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/8004325905_8cbf361560_b.jpg" width="1000" height="723" alt="Bagel and Pita Chips Before Baking"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the chips in one layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with 2-3 pinches of salt.  If needed, add a couple extra pinches of garam masala to any bits that need it.</p>
<p>Bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 15 minutes.  Set your timer for 10 minutes and start checking them for doneness at that point. The chips are done when they are beginning to crisp and turn a lightly golden brown. Be careful not to over-bake.  Remove and let cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004326992/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/8004326992_f183f9e6f2_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Sunflower Seeds"></a></p>
<p>Add the sunflower meats to a food processor and turn it on.  While running, add the oil and lemon juice and zest. Slowly add in the water until a smooth, creamy dip is formed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/8004325677/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8004325677_16d2dbcf32_b.jpg" width="1000" height="731" alt="Lemon Sunflower Spread with White Pepper"></a></p>
<p>Remove to a bowl and whisk in the salt, to taste, and the black pepper and tobasco.  If needed, add more liquid to get the texture you like.  Once the dip is ready, gently fold in any fresh chopped herbs you may be using.</p>
<p>The recipe makes a rather mild dip that would be appropriate even for kids&#8217; palates, so feel free to bump up the spices, tobasco, and lemon juice of you want something a bit zippier!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472514/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/7984472514_2e9a1776ce_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mushroom season! </p>
<p>I recently went on a wild edible plant walk here in the Boston area, and our guide told us that the best time to find mushrooms is between Labor Day and Columbus Day. We didn&#8217;t find any mushrooms on our walk, but he did get me thinking about making a recipe to show them off. I&#8217;m really interested in learning more about local wild, edible plants, so hopefully I&#8217;l be rooting around in the woods for some fungus soon.</p>
<p>And if you made the <a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">black pepper and cumin pickled carrots</a> from last week, here&#8217;s a recipe to try them with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473338/" title="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7984473338_48facfa999_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Any wild mushrooms will do for this recipe, but I picked out two of my favorites today: oyster mushrooms and chanterelles.  </p>
<p>Oyster mushrooms can be cultivated, so you are likely to find them outside of peak mushroom season. This also helps make them a bit more affordable than wild harvested mushrooms, but they are still many, many rungs up the ladder from the budget workhorse that is white button mushroom.  If you are interested, there are many resources online that describe how you can grow oyster mushrooms yourself, at home.</p>
<p>Chanterelles, however, do not cooperate with human cultivation. This means the mushrooms you see in the store were growing wild in a wood somewhere before they reached the shelves. The effort it takes to locate and collect them, their wonderfully complex flavor, and their perishable nature contribute to their price tag. </p>
<p>A note about using wild mushrooms: if you&#8217;re super squicky about eating a little dirt, this may not be the best food for you.  Washing mushrooms makes them soggy and sad.  I pick off anything that&#8217;s big enough to be picked off, and then chop it up and cook away without thinking too hard about what might be on them.  As long as the mushrooms are not slimy, don&#8217;t have any overly soft spots, aren&#8217;t hiding bugs, and don&#8217;t smell off&#8230; they are declared clean in my kitchen.  A little dirt from the middle of a forest won&#8217;t hurt you.</p>
<p>And if you found your own, just be careful!  Make sure you know what you have before you eat it.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Tostadas with Lime Creme Fraiche </strong><br />
<em>Makes Six Tostadas</em></p>
<p>Six Corn Tortillas<br />
Wild Mushroom Filling (recipe below)<br />
Lime Creme Fraiche (recipe below)<br />
1 Jalapeno Pepper, sliced thinly<br />
1 Small Bunch Fresh Cilantro Leaves, roughly chopped<br />
12 Pickled Carrot Sticks (<a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">recipe here</a>)<br />
1 Cup Daiya Vegan Cheese Shreds<br />
Oil </p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Filling</strong><br />
340g or 3/4lb Wild Mushrooms, weighed after trimming<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cumin<br />
1/2 tsp Dried Oregano<br />
1 tsp Earth Balance Spread or Oil<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p><strong>Lime Creme Fraiche</strong><br />
4 Tbs Tofutti Cream Cheese<br />
4 Tbs Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lime Juice</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473256/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7984473256_7cd4f2c24d_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopped Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the racks in your oven so one is in the middle and one is in the highest position.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
<p>Chop your mushrooms into a medium to small dice.  Add them to a dry skillet over medium high heat.  The mushrooms will begin to release moisture after a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473186/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7984473186_3448562707_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Wild Mushroom Filling"></a></p>
<p>After 3-4 minutes of cooking, add the salt, cumin and oregano. Keep an eye on the mushrooms and stir them every 10-15 seconds. Once most of the moisture has cooked out and they begin sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 7 minutes of total cooking time, add the Earth Balance and mix well.  Remove mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473120/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/7984473120_ee4d9234cc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Corn Tortillas"></a></p>
<p>Place six corn tortillas on a baking sheet.  Brush both sides very lightly with olive oil.  Put tortillas in the middle rack of the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes.  The edges of the tortilla should be beginning to curl and they should only barely have the slightest hint of color.  Remove from oven.</p>
<p>While the tortillas are baking, mix together the ingredients for the creme fraiche and refrigerate until ready to use.  It will take a lot of whisking to get the mixture smooth, but it will happen if you keep at it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984467283/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7984467283_24cb149b99_b.jpg" width="1000" height="808" alt="Mushroom, Jalapeno, Cilantro"></a></p>
<p>Once your tortillas are out of the oven, change the oven to the broil setting.  Get everything ready for assembly: sliced jalapenos, cilantro, carrot sticks, cheese, creme fraiche, mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472966/" title="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/7984472966_e8e2f67948_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>Evenly divide the mushroom mixture across the tortillas.  Top with a little vegan cheese.  Place in the oven, this time on the very top rack, to broil.  DO NOT WALK AWAY!  Watch them as they cook until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden brown.  Remove immediately.</p>
<p>Top each tostada with a dollop of the lime creme fraiche, some cilantro, a slice or two of jalapeno, and two picked carrot sticks.  Serve immediately.</p>

<p>Well.  Hello!  I&#8217;ve missed you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last two years working in animal rescue, but it&#8217;s time to dust off the blog and get back in the kitchen. Today I have a super simple but delicious appetizer to share with you.  It&#8217;s very nearly September and I am desperately clinging to the last gasps of summer.  This might just be my favorite time of year; farmer&#8217;s markets are overflowing and I fall in love with ingredients I&#8217;ve taken for granted all over again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978904/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8300/7888978904_3221d4bcc5.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomato Canapés"></a></p>
<p>Case in point: the tomato. </p>
<p>This recipe was made for the late-summer haul of juicy, sweet, perfect tomatoes. Use tomatoes worthy of a spotlight. If you happen to be growing your own grape tomatoes (and your own basil!) than this has got your name all over it.  It&#8217;s quick to prepare and tastes great at room temperature, so you can make a bunch and let your dinner party guests enjoy them at their leisure.  Perhaps on a deck with a nice bottle of red? I don&#8217;t have a deck, and didn&#8217;t throw a party, so I won&#8217;t tell if you just make these for yourself as a light snack on a weekend afternoon.  They are so easy you can absolutely make them without an occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Blackened Tomato Canapés</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 25 pieces</em></p>
<p>1 Pint Cherry Tomatoes<br />
Around 7 Slices of Sourdough Bread<br />
25 Basil Leaves<br />
1 Cup Balsamic Vinegar (or prepared/purchased balsamic glaze)<br />
Olive Oil<br />
Sea or Kosher Salt<br />
Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</p>
<p>Start off by preparing the crostini. Arrange your oven racks so you have one at the very top and set your oven to Broil.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888980400/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7888980400_4f2875958c.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Slice the sourdough into bite-sized triangles.  I like to cut the bottom crust off with a long chef&#8217;s knife (helps you get a nice clean edge) and create one big triangle.  Slice that in half for two triangles, and each of those in half again.  Each piece of bread should give you 4 small triangles.  You can save the scraps to make your own breadcrumbs, or toss them to the birds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888980222/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7888980222_e5a883ed94.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and brush lightly on one side with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979950/"> <img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/7888979950_06ca67c013.jpg" width="500" alt="Prepping the Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Season generously with sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper.  I like to go a little crazy with the black pepper, but if you don&#8217;t like its signature heat, you can ease up on it.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979650/"> <img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7888979650_d62cf25922.jpg" width="500" alt="Seasoned Crostini"></a></p>
<p>Broil for 2-4 minutes (watching constantly) until perfectly golden.  Remove from oven and set aside.  Do not walk away from these while they are in the oven or they will burn up!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979398/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/7888979398_273abf53a8.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomatoes"></a></p>
<p>Now grab your cast-iron skillet and put it over high heat, very lightly oiled.  You can make the tomatoes in a regular pan if you don&#8217;t have cast-iron, but a cast-iron pan is perfect for this application.  Once the pan starts to smoke, add the tomatoes.  Every 10 seconds or so, gently shake the pan to toss the tomatoes around.  We are looking to char the skin a little while only lightly cooking the tomatoes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you need to make your own balsamic glaze, add 1 cup of balsamic vinegar to a small sauce pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce about 75%, until it becomes a thick glaze, being careful not to burn.  Set aside when done.  This takes about 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888979156/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7888979156_4910261cb6.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomatoes"></a></p>
<p>The tomatoes are done when the skin is speckled with black char and begins to split.  You are not making tomato sauce, so don&#8217;t overcook them until they are mushy.  We want quick cooking over very high heat (about 5 minutes total) to add flavor but to keep the individual tomatoes whole.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978692/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7888978692_03e1021042.jpg" width="500" alt="Assembly"></a></p>
<p>Once all your ingredients are ready, begin assembly by placing a single basil leaf on each piece of crostini.  I like to flip the leaf inside out to create a little boat for the tomato to sit in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7888978358/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7888978358_9f2e045bdd.jpg" width="500" alt="Blackened Tomato Canapés"></a></p>
<p>Top each piece with a single tomato and drizzle the balsamic glaze over the top.  If you did not salt the bread enough before baking, you may wish to add a little pinch of salt over the top, but taste it first to be sure!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  If you happen to have leftover tomatoes, they would be a wonderful addition to just about any recipe.  I think they would be killer in pasta or chopped up as a salsa base.</p>

<p>This salad isn&#8217;t exactly&#8230; healthy.  What it <i>is</i>, exactly, is delicious.  And it has a surprise.  There&#8217;s no lettuce.  The greens are baby spinach, and raw kale.</p>
<p>Stay with me, here!</p>
<p>Yes, I said raw kale.  I know you are thinking that I have finally gone off the vegan deep end.  But I swear, the water is nice!</p>
<p>You can eat raw kale, too, if you pay attention to these three things: the kind, the cut, and the preparation.  Follow these three steps and I swear you&#8217;ll be eating your kale raw and loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Kind</strong><br />
The first step is finding the right kind of kale.  Lacinato kale is perfectly suited to eating raw.  I find that it&#8217;s thinner and more tender than the other varieties, but sadly, it&#8217;s not nearly as common.  Look for long, thin, flat leaves that are slightly dimpled.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897286/" title="Lacinato Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3420/3743897286_bc3b21d4ce.jpg" width="450" alt="Lacinato Kale" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not always obvious what the best cut is for a certain dish.  Small, thin strips of kale is integral for this salad, or any meal where the kale is served raw or lightly cooked.  When the kale is cut this way, the dressing has a much easier time tenderizing the kale without having to cook it.  Larger pieces of kale would be much harder to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />
With regular lettuce, you wait to add the dressing until just before serving.  Otherwise the salt and acid in the dressing starts to break down the fresh, crisp greens, leaving you with a soggy mess.  With a kale salad, this is to your advantage!  Dress the salad ahead of time and refrigerate it for a bit.  The dressing will soften up the kale just the right amount.  Plus, the addition of a creamy dressing compliments kale&#8217;s flavors nicely.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897708/" title="BLT Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3743897708_8ebeec3256.jpg" width="450" alt="BLT Salad" /></a></p>
<p>There are many fake bacon products out there.  My favorite is what I&#8217;ve used in this recipe, Lightlife&#8217;s Smoky Tempeh Strips.  While the package says &#8220;Fakin&#8217; Bacon&#8221; I find that it&#8217;s not at all like what I remember of the real thing, but I still like it.  It&#8217;s smoky and salty and tangy, and it&#8217;s AWESOME in this salad (or on sandwiches).  But as awesome as it is, bacon it is not.  If you&#8217;re looking for something that more closely approximates the texture and flavor of bacon, there are probably other brands out there, but I haven&#8217;t found one that I like.</p>
<p>One last note: due to the sturdy nature of kale, this is the perfect picnic and pot luck salad.  You can throw it together ahead of time and it&#8217;ll be perky and crisp when you get around to serving it.  If you&#8217;re looking for a side dish that can stand up to summer entertaining, this recipe is a good bet.</p>
<p><strong>BLT Salad</strong><br />
<em>4-6 Side Salads</em></p>
<p>1 Head Lacinato Kale (aka Tuscan or Dinosaur Kale)*<br />
1 Package <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=tempeh_smokystrips">Lightelife Organic Smoky Tempeh Strips</a>**<br />
2 Tbs Peanut Oil, divided<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Baby Spinach, Packed<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Sweet Cherry Tomatoes (about 25)</p>
<p><em>Dressing</em><br />
1/4 Cup Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Agave Nectar<br />
Freshly Ground Black Pepper</p>
<p><em>*You can also use regular lettuce if you like, just make sure not to add the dressing until just before serving.</em></p>
<p><em>**Sub baked tofu, another mock bacon, or my <a href="../../../2008/07/smokey-miso-tofu/index.html">Smoky Miso Tofu</a>.</em></p>
<p>Wash and dry kale. Using kitchen shears (or a knife, or your fingers), remove and discard the center stem from each leaf.  I find scissors makes the job quick and easy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105005/" title="Deveining Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3743105005_b7af46a4b0.jpg" width="450" alt="Deveining Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the kale leaves on top of each other and slice into thin strips with a sharp knife:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105089/" title="Chopping Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3743105089_379527acb3.jpg" width="450" alt="Chopping Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Place the cut kale into a large bowl.  Whisk the dressing together and toss with the kale until evenly coated.  If you are using regular lettuce, keep the dressing separate until just before serving.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, longer is no problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prepare the &#8220;bacon.&#8221;  Slice the tempeh strips into thin, small pieces, and pan-fry in 1 Tbs peanut oil for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp on the edges.  Drain on a paper towel and set aside:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897594/" title="Fakin' Bacon (tempeh) by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2487/3743897594_8e5d19e925.jpg" width="450" alt="Fakin' Bacon (tempeh)" /></a></p>
<p>Next, add another tablespoon of peanut oil to the same pan you cooked the bacon in (don&#8217;t wash it out!).  Cook the tomatoes with 1/4 tsp salt for 3 minutes over high heat, or until beginning to soften and the juices are starting to come out.  Remove to a bowl, with juices, and set aside.</p>
<p><strong>Assembling the salad</strong></p>
<p>Once you are ready to serve the salad, chop up the baby spinach and toss it with the kale, making sure everything is now covered in dressing.  If you are using regular lettuce, mix in the dressing now.  Add 3/4 of the bacon and the tomatoes and toss again.  Plate, topping the salad with the rest of the bacon and some freshly cracked black pepper.  Serve.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848517/" title="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3528848517_ba3b8a03fc.jpg" width="450" alt="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>My husband and I have been watching The Sopranos recently (yes, I&#8217;m apparently 10 years behind the curve here), and I can only listen to the characters talk about manicotti and baked ziti so many times before I get a serious craving for some Italian food.  It got me thinking to a public television cooking show I saw a while ago, <a href="http://www.lidiasitaly.com/tv-show">Lidia&#8217;s Italy</a>.  I remember she made a lasagna that used bread instead of noodles, and it struck me as brilliant.  </p>
<p>I know making pasta isn&#8217;t hard, but there&#8217;s something about boiling lasagna noodles that is a huge pain in the ass.  They&#8217;re huge, you must not over cook them, you have to prevent them from sticking to each other after draining&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;m just lazy, but the idea of using bread really caught my attention.  Of course, I couldn&#8217;t find Lydia&#8217;s recipe to go from, so this version is totally made up by me.  But not only do I want to credit her for general inspiration, she also has an Italian cooking show, so she gives my crazy bread lasagna some legitimacy.  Maybe.  Shhh.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to use is a loaf of pre-sliced, crusty sourdough.  I know I recommend sourdough for everything, but really, it&#8217;s awesome in this dish.  You want the favor, of course, but you also want a sturdy &#8220;artisan&#8221; type bread that won&#8217;t fall apart in the oven.  This isn&#8217;t a job for sliced sandwich bread.  It&#8217;s best with bread that is even perhaps a little stale.  Look for a quality sliced loaf in the day old section of your grocer and save a buck or two.</p>
<p>You can put absolutely anything in this lasagna.  I picked eggplants because I had three of them.  I think they are lovely in this, so I recommend them, but really, stuff this with whatever you like or whatever is handy.</p>
<p><strong>Rustic Bread &#038; Eggplant Lasagna</strong><br />
<em>Serves 9-12</em></p>
<p>3 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
4-6 Cloves Garlic, minced (optional)<br />
2 28 oz Cans Organic Tomatoes, blended<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
4 tsp Dried Italian Herbs<br />
Olive Oil, for drizzling<br />
2-3 Medium Eggplants, peeled<br />
8-10 Large Slices of Sourdough Bread<br />
1 Cup Breadcrumbs (or 2 more pieces of bread for toasting and food processing)<br />
1-2 Large, Ripe Tomatoes, fresh, for garnish<br />
Basil, for garnish</p>
<p>In a very large skillet with high sides, or a sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.  Sweat the garlic for 1-2 minutes, then add tomatoes, salt, and herbs.  Cook for 30 minutes (bubbling), stirring occasionally.  Invert a mesh strainer over the top of the pan to prevent splatter, if desired.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400º F.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prep two baking sheets with parchment paper.  Peel the eggplants by slicing off the top and bottom and using the cut edge to start your vegetable peeler.  Holding the eggplant vertically, cut the eggplants into 1/2 inch slices.  Arrange in one layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and drizzle liberally with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660042/" title="Eggplant before roasting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/3529660042_3b549a2597.jpg" width="450" alt="Eggplant before roasting" /></a></p>
<p>Bake eggplant for 30-40 minutes at 400º, turning once, until very, very soft and browned in some places.</p>
<p>Spray both sides of each slice of bread with spray oil and &#8220;grill&#8221; in a hot skillet until browned on both sides.  You can also simply toast the bread, but I think you get more flavor with grilling.</p>
<p>In a large baking dish (a lasagna dish), spread 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce.  Line the bottom of the dish with bread, filling as many as the gaps as possible without overlapping.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660088/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2058/3529660088_c32010c4dc.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Place half of the eggplant on top of the bread, followed by another 1 to 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660130/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3529660130_8e0975a2f8.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add a second layer of bread.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848331/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/3528848331_671f247db1.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add the second half of the eggplant, and all of the remaining sauce.  Make sure that the bread is completely covered by sauce.  Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660212/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/3529660212_7915e068b1.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Place fresh tomato slices on the top of the lasagna, sprinkled with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848403/" title="Before baking by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2349/3528848403_1d24032941.jpg" width="450" alt="Before baking" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 40 minutes at 400º F.  Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660322/" title="After baking by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/3529660322_b299601825.jpg" width="450" alt="After baking" /></a></p>
<p>Top with basil leaves and drizzle sweet and thick balsamic vinegar (or balsamic syrup) on the plate if desired.  Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3468328175/" title="Potato Salad with Fava Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3541/3468328175_aa2db54c9d_b.jpg" width="450" alt="Potato Salad with Fava Beans" /></a></p>
<p>I never was a potato salad person.  I&#8217;m not sure why.  I think it&#8217;s partly because when someone else makes potato salad, you&#8217;re not exactly sure what&#8217;s in it, and it&#8217;s just this mass of white lumpy stuff.  Plus, people tend to add raw onions to potato salad, which ruins it for me instantaneously.</p>
<p>I went to Whole Foods to look at all the pretty produce to get inspired and they had these teeny tiny new potatoes that were begging me to buy them.  They were about the size of walnuts, red and yellow, and completely adorable.  Yes, I totally buy food based on how adorable it is sometimes.  Don&#8217;t tell anyone.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I knew I had to make potato salad, even though I&#8217;d never made it myself.  So I asked my contacts on twitter how they liked their potato salad.  I think I got 40 to 50 replies, and no consensus at all.  Some people like creamy, other prefer a vinaigrette.  Onions and celery ruin it for a good number of people, others can&#8217;t eat it without.  The only generalization I could come up with is that people are only guaranteed to like the potato salad they make themselves, and that even one offensive ingredient can ruin the whole thing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s comforting for party planning, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I decided to make two very simple potato salads (simple but totally tasty), one with a creamy dressing and one with a vinaigrette.  That way you can each take the base recipe you prefer and then add all the pickles/celery/hot sauce/red pepper/tomatoes/onions/sweet potatoes/celery seed/relish you want!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3468328051/" title="Fresh Fava Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/3468328051_d279a964d4.jpg" width="450" alt="Fresh Fava Beans" /></a></p>
<p>Right next to the potatoes was a huge pile of (not so adorable) fava beans.  I knew they&#8217;d make a great addition to one of the salads.  They&#8217;re wonderfully green and nutty, but also fleeting!  Grab them fast, because they&#8217;ll be gone before you know it.  If you can&#8217;t find them, use shelled fresh edamame or shelled peas.</p>
<p>Fava beans do require a bit of prep work, so be forewarned.  You need to shuck them, then blanch them, then remove them from their seed casings.  It&#8217;s not hard work, but it does require you to set some time aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3469139412/" title="Potato Salad with Fava Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3534/3469139412_4f3e0974da.jpg" width="450" alt="Potato Salad with Fava Beans" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Potato Salad with Fava Beans</strong><br />
<em>Serves 2-4</em></p>
<p>1 1/2 to 2 lbs New potatoes, halved<br />
1 1/2 Lbs Fresh Fava Beans, or 3/4 cup Edamame or Peas</p>
<p>Dressing:<br />
1/2 Cup Vegenaise Mayonnaise*<br />
2 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
2 Tbs Fresh Herbs (I used parsley and marjoram)<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Fresh Black Pepper</p>
<p>*This brand is highly recommended. It&#8217;s the closest to non-vegan mayo I&#8217;ve found, by far.</p>
<p>Whisk together the ingredients for the dressing.  Refrigerate it until ready to use.</p>
<p>Shuck the fava beans by &#8220;unzipping&#8221; them and breaking open the pods.  Blanch the whitish-green beans in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes.  Remove and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking.  Use your nail to break open the seed cases and squeeze out the bright green bean.  Set aside.</p>
<p>Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until tender but not falling apart.  You can also cook them in a pressure cooker on the second ring for 4 minutes, using the natural-release method.</p>
<p>Let the potatoes cool, but not all the way. When the potatoes are still hot/warm, but cool enough to handle, mix them with the dressing and fava beans.  Let sit for several minutes before serving to allow the flavors to blend, or refrigerate until ready to serve.  I think it tastes the best at room temperature or slightly warm, so serving them shortly after preparing is best.</p>

<p><strong>Potato Salad with Herbed Dijon Vinaigrette</strong><br />
<em>Serves 2-4</em></p>
<p>1 1/2 to 2 lbs New potatoes, halved</p>
<p>Dressing:<br />
1/4 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br />
1 tsp White Wine Vinegar<br />
1/2 tsp Fresh Black Pepper<br />
2 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/4 Packed Cup Parsley, chopped<br />
1/8 tsp Red Pepper Flakes<br />
1/2 tsp Paprika<br />
1/4 tsp Sugar</p>
<p>Whisk together the ingredients for the dressing.  A small blender like the magic bullet works well to help emulsify the dressing, but you can easily whisk it by hand.  Set aside the dressing until ready to use.</p>
<p>Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until tender but not falling apart.  You can also cook them in a pressure cooker on the second ring for 4 minutes, using the natural-release method.</p>
<p>Let the potatoes cool, but not all the way. When the potatoes are still hot/warm, but cool enough to handle, mix them with the dressing.  Let sit for several minutes before serving to allow the flavors to blend, or refrigerate until ready to serve.  I think it tastes best at room temperature or slightly warm, so serving them shortly after preparing is best.</p>
<p>For a little twist, you can reheat leftover vinaigrette potatoes under the broiler until crispy and heated through.</p>

<p>I first encountered daifuku at one of my favorite restaurants in Western Massachusetts, <A href="http://freshsideamherst.com/">Fresh Side</a>.  In their deli case were these cute little white and green pillow-looking desserts, sitting behind a hand-written card that said: Mochi (vegan).</p>
<p>I ordered one and when I bit into it, it was such a surprise.  First, the texture!  It&#8217;s like a dense marshmallow, chewy and soft.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  Next, the filling.  Beans.  Beans?  Beans.  This particular mochi was fillied with a sweetened red bean paste, also called anko, and I think it was the first time I had ever had sweet beans.  And it was really good!</p>
<p>Now, if I understand correctly, mochi is a catch-all term for a sweet dessert made with glutenous rice flour dough.  It can be baked, wrapped around ice cream, eaten plain, or filled.  Filled mochi, like the ones I&#8217;m blogging about today, are called daifuku.  </p>
<p>Anko is one of the most common fillings, but many people also use berries.  Strawberry filled ones are very popular in the spring, and they&#8217;re called ichigo daifuku.  Whole raspberries also work, and sometimes people include a white sweetened bean paste (as opposed to red) known as shiroan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000898/" title="Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3329000898_e70bc58f88.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Now what if I told you that I made these in the microwave?</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>I was skeptical, too.  The microwave in my house is pretty much reserved for reheating leftovers.  When I decided to make these, I was sort of shocked that all the recipes online called for nuking the dough.  What&#8217;s more, they were pretty unclear about how to tell when you&#8217;re dough is ready.  Microwaves seem to vary so much in power, 3 minutes in one microwave is very different than 3 minutes in another.  But I decided to give it a go, and not only did it work, but it was really, really easy.  If you are able to find pre-made red bean paste, you can make this whole recipe with only a microwave and just a few minutes. </p>
<p>So not only do you not need a kitchen for these (hello dorm-living vegans!), they&#8217;re also gluten free (hi celiacs!), soy free (hi soy&#8230;allergic lovelies!), fast (hi lazy people!), customizable (hi picky people!), and did I mention CUTE?  Traditional colors are white, green, and pink, but food coloring isn&#8217;t required if it grosses you out.  Matcha (green tea powder) is a natural and delicious flavoring that makes the mochi green.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165909/" title="Mochiko by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3328165909_4159851a76_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Mochiko" /></a>Now the one thing you absolutely need, no substitutions, is mochiko.  It&#8217;s glutenous rice flour, and no other flour will work for this.  You can find it easily at any asian market.</p>
<p>Also make sure you have some cornstarch or potato starch handy, the dough is very sticky!</p>
<p><strong>Daifuku</strong><br />
<em>Makes 10-12 Filled Cakes</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Mochiko<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Water<br />
2-3 Drops red or green food coloring, optional<br />
Cornstarch or Potato Starch, for dusting</p>
<p><em>Filling Ideas</em><br />
Anko (store bought or recipe below)<br />
Strawberries<br />
Raspberries</p>
<p><strong>Anko</strong><br />
<em>Makes enough for 3-4 batches of daifuku</em></p>
<p>1 14 oz Can Adzuki Beans<br />
1/2 Cup Water<br />
1 Cup Sugar<br />
1 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
1-2 Pinches Salt</p>
<p>Heat water and sugar separately until boiling and sugar is dissolved, turn off heat.  Drain and rinse beans.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000762/" title="Adzuki Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3329000762_0332e4c645.jpg" width="450" alt="Adzuki Beans" /></a></p>
<p>Add to a pan and mash.  Add 1/3 cup of the simple syrup you just made, along with salt and vegetable oil, and mash over medium heat.  Beans will thicken and become slightly glossy.  Add more syrup if desired.  Turn out into a bowl and let cool.</p>
<p><em>Making the Mochi</em></p>
<p>Add the mochiko, sugar, water, and food coloring (if using) to a microwave safe bowl.  Stir well, making sure there are no lumps.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as best you can with a rubber spatula, otherwise they&#8217;ll get all gross when the dough is microwaved.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165939/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3317/3328165939_f2de866948.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Cover lightly with plastic wrap and mircowave for 2 minutes.  Remove bowl from the microwave and stir VERY well.  Dough will be much thicker, but there should still be some raw parts underneath.  I like to use a sturdy silicone spatula to mix the dough at this point.  Place the dough back in the microwave for 1 more minute.  </p>
<p>Open the door and peek&#8211;did the dough start sinking as soon as the door opened?  If so, the dough was inflating while cooking, which means it&#8217;s ready.  If not, microwave for 1 more minute and check again.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to microwave for more than 4 minutes total (2 minutes initial cooking, 2 more additional minutes after mixing).</p>
<p>One the dough deflates when you open the door, remove the dough from the microwave and scrape it out onto a cornstarch-coated cutting board.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165993/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3328165993_981b983f39.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Pat the hot dough (be careful! It&#8217;s hot!) with cornstarch and flatten it out a little.  Cut into 10-12 even pieces.  Add 1 tsp of filling to each piece and gently press the edges together to seal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000858/" title="Making Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3542/3329000858_0f09123ef8.jpg" width="450" alt="Making Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the whole process in a little HD video for you to watch!  No sound, so don&#8217;t worry about turning down the volume if you&#8217;re at work. The video starts right after I took the dough out of the mircowave and dumped it onto the cutting board.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/3473920">Making Daifuku</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to keep these fresh is to individually wrap them in plastic wrap and then refrigerate.  If you leave them out, unwrapped, they&#8217;ll get dry and tough.  Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671457/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1187/3266671457_03448c94b6.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you that want to try out the candied clementines but maybe don&#8217;t want to eat them whole (yes, you can eat the peel!), I offer you this lovely clementine bundt cake.  It&#8217;s a more traditional dessert for sure, but I think more broadly appealing than the candied clementines.  </p>
<p>I blended up the candied clementines I had leftover from the last post, and it became this gorgeous, thick, marmalade-like spread.  I thought it would be absolutely perfect to flavor a bundt cake with, and I was right.  I think I prefer the cake to the clementines alone!</p>
<p>This cake was so perfectly moist and fluffy, I nearly teared up when I had the first bite.  It&#8217;s a wonderful combination of sweet, citrusy, and slightly bitter (in a good way) from the peel.  The clementine flavored poured fondant is really the ideal topping.  But don&#8217;t get scared off at the mention of poured fondant.  It&#8217;s super easy.  And it&#8217;s bakery quality icing.  You have to try it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671415/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3266671415_b4a043ea02_b.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a></p>
<p>You see, I like icing glazes, but it can be tricky to get the thickness right when you&#8217;re mixing powdered sugar with liquid.  Too thin and it just soaks into the cake a disappears, too thick and it doesn&#8217;t pour at all.  And there&#8217;s always that vague grainy mouth feel it leaves behind, thanks to the cornstarch in the powdered sugar.  I thought if I cooked it a little bit the powdered sugar would dissolve and help thicken the sugar (same idea for your basic stir-fry sauce thickened with cornstarch!).  But then I also remembered poured fondant.</p>
<p>I discovered poured fondant when I made <a href="../../../2008/01/petits-fours/index.html">petits fours</a>.  It&#8217;s a sugar-based icing that is heated until the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/video/softball.html">&#8220;soft ball&#8221;</a> stage, or 235-240º F.  If you have a candy thermometer handy, use it, but it&#8217;s NOT necessary.  Since we&#8217;re only making a small amount of icing, I can pretty much guarantee you that boiling the icing for 10-20 seconds will bring you to the soft ball stage.  Easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266671247/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3313/3266671247_0eff6039d1_m.jpg" width="163" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a>The cool part about fondant?  It sets, hard and glossy, when it cools.  So once you&#8217;ve heated it enough, you whisk it off the heat until it starts to thicken and pour it over your cake.  And like magic, it&#8217;ll harden and you&#8217;ll have totally perfect, totally professional-looking icing on your cake.  The icing in the photos?  Completely dry and set, even though it looks like it was just poured.  And if it cools too much before you&#8217;re ready to ice, just re-heat it to thin.</p>
<p>Plus, it tastes amazing because I use fresh clementine juice for the liquid as opposed to water.  Give it a try, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>Candied Clementine Cake</strong><br />
<em>Makes One Bundt Cake</em></p>
<p>1 1/2 Cup <a href="../../../2009/02/candied-clementines/index.html">Candied Clementine</a> Puree, around 5-8 clementines<br />
1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil<br />
1 1/4 Cup Soymilk, or other non-dairy milk<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
2 Cups All-Purpose Flour<br />
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
2 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
2 Fresh Clementines, for garnish</p>
<p><em>Clementine Poured Fondant</em><br />
1 1/4 Cup Confectioner&#8217;s Sugar<br />
3 Tbs Fresh Clementine Juice, or other citrus (about 3 clementines)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350º F.</p>
<p>Puree the clementines in a food processor until fairly smooth, but small bits of peel are desirable in  my opinion! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3266670991/" title="Candied Clementine Puree by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3266670991_99caf8b238.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Puree" /></a></p>
<p>Combine the clementine puree with the oil, soymilk, and sugar.  Whisk until smooth.</p>
<p>Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in another bowl.  </p>
<p>Grease a bundt pan with spray oil, vegan margarine like Earth Balance, or vegetable shortening.  Scoop a few spoonfuls of the dry mixture into the greased bundt pan and turn the pan to coat the sides and center spike.  Rap the pan against the counter to loosen any extra flour and pour it back into the dry mixture.</p>
<p>Fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture until combined.  Pour the batter into prepared bundt pan.  It&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s a little thick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3267496830/" title="Candied Clementine CakeI Batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1138/3267496830_5b82a417d7.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine CakeI Batter" /></a></p>
<p>Bake at 350º F for 45-50 minutes until a cake tester comes out clean.  Let cool upside-down on a large plate.  After a few minutes the cake <i>should</i> drop out of the pan onto the plate in one piece, assuming you didn&#8217;t miss any spots when greasing and dusting with flour.  Let cake cool completely before icing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3267496894/" title="Candied Clementine Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1195/3267496894_01f7b94936.jpg" width="450" alt="Candied Clementine Cake" /></a></p>
<p><i>Clementine Poured Fondant</i></p>
<p>Whisk powdered sugar with 3 Tbs of clementine juice.  Add to a small sauce pan and bring to a rolling boil for 10-20 seconds, or until it reaches the soft-ball stage (235-240º F).  </p>
<p>Remove from heat and whisk constantly until it starts to thicken.  At first, the icing will be a glossy yellow (similar to egg yolks), and it will gradually thicken and become lighter as it cools.  You want to pour it over the cake when it&#8217;s very clearly thickened, but not too cool (i.e. thick) to pour.  If the icing becomes too thick, simply reheat and start again.</p>
<p>Dust the cake with powdered sugar to finish, and garnish with fresh clementine segments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103472264/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/3103472264_e9725f2f58.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>This is a super cute dessert idea for winter-themed parties, and it isn&#8217;t much harder than making and frosting cupcakes.  If you have a sharp knife, some toothpicks, a piping bag and a star tip, you&#8217;re good to go.  It&#8217;s even more fun to make than it is to look at, or eat!</p>
<p>All I did was bake some cupcakes, cut them into cone shapes, stack them (secured with toothpicks) and then frosted them in such a way so that they looked like pine trees.  Powdered sugar adds a little snow.  At first I was bummed that my powdered sugar had so many HUGE lumps in it, until I realized they looked like little snow boulders.  Score!  You could get really creative and make little marzipan pine cones, or birds, or squirrels&#8230; you get the idea.  Why not make a sweet little forest for your friends and family to devour?</p>
<p>Oh man, I just realized I could have built an igloo out of sugar cubes.  Next time, I guess!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102642011/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/3102642011_b68a7c25a0.jpg" width="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>I used gel food coloring, both green and blue mixed together to get the shade right.  Using only green was too light and minty for what I was going for &#8211; so make sure you have some blue on hand to darken it up.  But there&#8217;s no reason your trees need to be green.  White trees would be stunning on a darker plate, or other non-standard colors like pink or brown to play up their cutesy, cartoony look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102638363/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/3102638363_962ea460c8.jpg" width="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Basic Sponge Cake</strong><br />
<em>Makes 15 cupcakes (a few extra for practicing)</em></p>
<p>1 1/3 Cups Soymilk mixed with 1 tsp Apple Cider vinegar<br />
2 Cups All Purpose Flour<br />
1 Cup Sugar<br />
2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1 Tbs Cornstarch<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 Cup Oil<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 tsp Almond Extract</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375º F.</p>
<p>Mix soymilk and vinegar.  Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch and salt and mix well.  Add oil and extracts to soymilk mixture and whisk.  Add wet to dry and fold until just combined.  Fill each lined, sprayed cupcake mold with 1/4 cup batter.  Bake cupcakes at 375º F for 20 minutes.  Remove from pans and let cool completely.</p>
<p><strong>Frosting</strong><br />
<em>Enough for 5-7 trees</em></p>
<p>1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/2 Cup Non-hydrogenated Shortening<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
About 3 Cups Powered Sugar, sifted, more if needed<br />
Food Coloring (green and blue for standard trees)</p>
<p>In a stand mixer, whip margarine and shortening until light and fluffy.  Whip in extract.  Slowly whip in powdered sugar until icing is fairly stiff.  Add coloring bit-by-bit until desired color is reached.  Transfer icing to a piping bag fitted it a small/standard sized star tip</p>
<p><strong>Creating the Trees</strong></p>
<p>Bake the cupcakes!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102629385/" title="Cupcakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3269/3102629385_7fb838b431.jpg" width="450" alt="Cupcakes" /></a></p>
<p>Unwrap the cupcakes and turn them upside-down.  With a knife, carve the cupcake into a cone.  If needed, flatten the base so the cupcake cone sits without wobbling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103461840/" title="Carving Cake by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/3103461840_8ca49e01e6.jpg" width="450" alt="Carving Cake" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the cupcakes to make basic tree shapes.  Three high for tall trees, two high for short trees.  Secure with toothpicks.  You may want t make the base of your trees squatty so that they help the tree stand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3103463022/" title="Basic Tree Shape by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/3103463022_b198d1bc29.jpg" width="450" alt="Basic Tree Shape" /></a></p>
<p>Create your forest!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102632765/" title="Cupcake Forest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/3102632765_32d785bc74.jpg" width="450" alt="Cupcake Forest" /></a></p>
<p>Begin icing your trees.  If you don&#8217;t have a revolving cake platter to ice on, use a small cutting board that you can easily turn as you work.  Start from the bottom and ice around and around up towards the top.  Use long-ish strokes that end in an upward sweep to create branches.  You can go back and fill in holes or weird spots later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102633979/" title="Icing Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3102633979_8e7c5a6835.jpg" width="450" alt="Icing Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Finish off with shorter, horizontal or upward pointing branches, and then one directly on top pointing straight up.  Take a look at your tree and add branches where needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3102635913/" title="Winter Pine Tree Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/3102635913_bc8181159b.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Winter Pine Tree Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Use a spatula to gently and carefully transfer the trees to your serving plate.  Add lumps of powdered sugar if you have them, and anything else to finish up the forest scene.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar to add snow to the trees.</p>
<p>Happy winter!</p>

<p>I love snickerdoodles.  Plain sugar cookies just don&#8217;t do it for me, but roll them in a little cinnamon-sugar and I&#8217;m sold.  (Roll nearly anything in cinnamon sugar and I&#8217;m sold.)</p>
<p>This is a cookie that preforms beautifully when veganized.  If you have a family recipe you use, I can almost guarantee you that all you need to do is sub Earth Balance Margarine for butter and Ener-g G Egg Replacer for eggs and you&#8217;ll be set.  Here is a recipe I made after checking out several different snickerdoodle recipes.  It&#8217;s fast, easy, and pretty near failproof.  In fact, stick some ribbon on them and you have an instant holiday gift!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079215842/" title="Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/3079215842_d6d8f79b94.jpg" width="450" alt="Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3078380887/" title="Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/3078380887_7d1a813189_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Snickerdoodles" /></a>One thing you should know, that I just found out today.  The temperature of the cookie dough as it goes in the oven determines the shape and overall look of the cookies.  If you want cookies that are pillowy and show a lot of cracks and texture, the dough needs to be pretty cold as it goes into the oven.  If you like thinner, more even-looking cookies, let the dough warm up a little before baking.</p>
<p>If the dough is cold, the cookies don&#8217;t have much time to warm up and flatten out before the outside of the cookie bakes and prevents further expansion.  If it&#8217;s already a little warm, the cookies will expand and spread (and flatten) in the first few minutes of cooking.  The pictures above are cookies baked when the dough was cold.  The photo to the left was made with warmer-dough.</p>
<p>These cookies are a snap if you make them in a stand-mixer, but only take slightly more elbow grease if you&#8217;re doing them by hand.  And they ship beautifully.  </p>
<p><strong>Snickerdoodles</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 18 Cookies</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Sugar<br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 Prepared Ener-g Egg-Replacer Egg<br />
1 1/2 Cups Flour<br />
1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar<br />
1/4 tsp Baking Soda</p>
<p>Cinnamon Sugar, for rolling</p>
<p>Cream sugar, Earth Balance, and vanilla extract together.  Prepare the Ener-G Egg by following the package instructions (1 1/2 tsp powder whisked with 2 Tbs hot water until foamy), and add it to the Earth Balance and sugar mixture.  Whip (or whisk) it all up until it&#8217;s light a fluffy, like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079207826/" title="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/3079207826_b9efd8b695.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar" /></a></p>
<p>Whisk the dry ingredients together.  Add 2/3 of the dry ingredients to the whipped mixture and whip until combined.  Add in the remaining flour and mix by hand.  Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375º F.</p>
<p>When the dough is chilled, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Using a #40 ice cream scoop, make balls of dough (each ball will be made with 2 Tbs of dough, if you don&#8217;t have a #40 scoop).  Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079208288/" title="Making Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/3079208288_96b7631b30.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Making Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p>Now time to squish them!  Using a fork (or whatever you want), squish the dough out into cookie shapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3079209646/" title="Making Snickerdoodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/3079209646_a057b4c4b4.jpg" width="450" alt="Making Snickerdoodles" /></a></p>
<p>Bake at 375º F for 10 minutes for chewy cookies, 12 minutes for crunchy.  Remove from oven and let sit for 30 seconds.  They&#8217;ll be very soft when they come out of the oven, but that&#8217;s just fine!  Gently remove cookies from the baking sheet and let cool for a few minutes on a wire rack before serving.</p>
<p>These are especially good with soy nog.  Just saying.</p>
