<p>So basically, my crock pot hates me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supposed to be one of the easiest appliances to use, right?  Everytime I&#8217;ve tried to <em>something</em> has gone wrong.  Things are either over cooked or undercooked, and definitely not very tasty.  I decided I needed to find a recipe that couldn&#8217;t possibly fail.  When I realized I had 5 pounds of apples, I had my answer.</p>
<p>I found a recipe for crock pot apple butter, and it seemed super easy.  Peel and chop the apples, add sugar and spices, let cook overnight.  I could do that.  My crock pot could do that.</p>
<p>It turns out peeling and chopping 5 1/2 pounds of apples is kind of a pain in the a&#8230;pple.  Your hands get all slippery and tired, and you get sticky apple juice everywhere.  Then the apples didn&#8217;t fit into my crockpot, so I had to puree them all in order to make the most of the space I had.  Finally I got everything in the crock pot and turned it on.  The recipe said the whole thing would take less than 12 hours.  Great!</p>
<p>12 hours later?  Not even close to done.</p>
<p>I ended up cooking this apple butter for a full 24 hours.  Between prepping, cooking, and canning, the whole project took 26 hours!  26!  A lot of that was downtime, but still.  My crock pot is cursed.</p>
<p>It was so worth it though.  It&#8217;s dark, sweet, tangy, silky, and spicy.  It is SO GOOD on toast with a little vegan margarine, you have no idea.  It&#8217;s like concentrated apple pie.  I wish you could taste it.  Well, actually, you might be able to!</p>
<p>Since I have a lot of this stuff, and it&#8217;s such a b&#8230;anana to make, I&#8217;m going to give away three jars to VeganYumYum readers.  Yay!</p>

2)  Use a valid email address! (Will not be published!)<br />
3)  Win apple butter!</p>
<p>In one week (November 11th at 5 PM), I&#8217;ll use a random number generator to pick three numbers, corresponding to the comments here.  Those people win a 1/2 pint jar of organic apple butter, complete with fun spreader knife and recipe card.  I&#8217;ll email you to tell you you&#8217;ve won: just reply with a mailing address.</p>
<p><strong>Some general rules:</strong> If you don&#8217;t leave a valid email address with your comment, I&#8217;ll pick another person.  If I don&#8217;t hear back from you with your mailing address, I&#8217;ll pick another person.  I&#8217;ll ship overseas, so don&#8217;t worry, everyone can play!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t win, here&#8217;s the recipe.  I used <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Crock-Pot-Apple-Butter-93886">this recipe found I online</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Crock Pot Apple Butter</strong><br />
<em>Makes 4 Pints</em></p>
<p>5 1/2 lbs Apples, peeled and finely chopped (as many different kinds as you can!)<br />
4 Cups Sugar<br />
2-3 tsp Cinnamon<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cloves<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 Sprinkle Nutmeg</p>
<p>Peel and core the apples.  Slice finely or puree in a food processor.  Add apples and remaining ingredients to your crock pot.  Cook on high for 1 hour, then on low for 8-10 hours.  Remove lid (or crack it open a bit) and cook on high until a wooden spoon stands upright in it.  The apple butter will have reduced by about half to get to this point.  Blend if desired.</p>
<p>Fill sterilized jars with simmering apple butter and process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath.  Remove jars and let sit, undisturbed, overnight.  Test the seals and refrigerate any jars that have not sealed completely.  Fully sealed jars will keep for 18-24 months unopened.  Once opened, the apple butter will keep for 2 months in the refrigerator, or indefinitely in the freezer.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2809040225/" title="Ground Cherries by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2809040225_31d0c5170d.jpg" alt="Ground Cherries" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Ground cherries.  I had absolutely no idea what they were until I saw them at a farmers market here in Boston.  When I walked by them I said, &#8220;Aww, baby tomatillos!&#8221;  The sign said &#8220;ground cherries&#8221; so I asked the woman more about them.  She carefully unwrapped one from it&#8217;s papery husk and handed it to me.</p>
<p>Wow, so weird.  And so good.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re the size of cherry tomatoes.  The ripe ones are a pale golden yellow.  They have a hint (just a <em>hint</em>) of tomato, but are much sweeter.  They smell like fresh strawberries, have the sweetness of grapes, and have a vaguely pineapple flavor.  And a little vanilla, too.  Weird.  But good.</p>
<p>I picked up two little cartons and then let them sit on my counter for four days.  I couldn&#8217;t figure out what to do with them, and I thought the point would be moot since they were probably spoiled.  But nope!  They store extremely well in the fridge, and as it turns out, pretty well on your counter top, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2809886468/" title="Ground Cherries by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2809886468_77bd873aa5.jpg" alt="Ground Cherries" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>The most traditional way to use them is in pie.  I been thinking about a way to make miniature pies in cupcake tins, so here was my chance to try it out.  The upshot is that you can use the technique with whatever fruit you can find, should ground cherries not be available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822026441/" title="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/2822026441_1cd1a9a48b.jpg" alt="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies" width="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies</strong><br />
<em>Makes Six </em></p>
<p><em>Pate Brisee</em> (pie dough)<br />
1 1/4 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1 1/2 tsp Sugar<br />
1/2 Cup Cubed, Chilled Earth Balance Margarine<br />
2 Tbs &#8211; 1/4 Cup Ice Water</p>
<p>1 1/3 Cup Ground Cherries, de-husked and washed<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar + 1/2 tsp Flour</p>
<p>Begin by making the pie dough.  For a step-by-step, see <a href="../../../../2008/05/easy-tarte-aux-pommes/index.html">this recipe</a>.</p>
<p>Line a cupcake tin with cupcake papers.  Spray lightly with oil.  Place a scant tablespoon of dough into the bottom of each cup.  Using a small glass dipped in water (one that has the same diameter of the bottom of the cupcake cup), press the dough to form a bottom crust.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822017015/" title="Cupcake Pie Shells by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2822017015_1b4b3c7c27.jpg" alt="Cupcake Pie Shells" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Take small pieces of dough and build up the sides of the cup with dough,  making sure the walls aren&#8217;t too thick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822017795/" title="Cupcake Pie Shells by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2822017795_4e46252d14.jpg" alt="Cupcake Pie Shells" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, you can use the glass again, dipped in water so it won&#8217;t stick, to neaten everything up if you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822854842/" title="Cupcake Pie Shells by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2822854842_7bab7c95ae.jpg" alt="Cupcake Pie Shells" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Your finished pie shells should look something like this.  Place the shells in the refrigerator for a few minutes to firm up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822856606/" title="Cupcake Pie Shells by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/2822856606_25cc85ae8e.jpg" alt="Cupcake Pie Shells" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400º F.  Remove the shells from the fridge and fill to the top, slightly overflowing, with ground cherries (or whatever fruit you&#8217;re using).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822858176/" title="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2822858176_faeef909f3.jpg" alt="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Add 1/2 to 1 tsp of the sugar/flour mixture to each cup, depending on how sweet you want your pies. 1/2 tsp was sweet enough for me, allowing the flavor of the fruit to show through.  If you&#8217;re using something tangier or less sweet, you&#8217;ll want more sugar.</p>
<p>Cover the back of a cookie sheet with a sheet of plastic wrap.  Add the rest of the pie dough, and cover with a second sheet.  Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to 1/4-1/8&#8243; thick.  Using a glass that has a slightly larger diameter than the openings of the cupcake cups, stamp out six pie crust tops.  Place this in the freezer for a few minutes, or into the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822023573/" title="Pie Tops by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3064/2822023573_e067102442.jpg" alt="Pie Tops" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Once chilled, you should be able to easily peel out the tops and place them over your pies.  Pinch the edges down, slash a X in the top with a sharp knife, and sprinkle with sugar.  You can do other types of tops, such as lattice work, if desired.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822860962/" title="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2822860962_1f0fe7aaab.jpg" alt="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pies" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 30 &#8211; 35 minutes, until golden brown.  Let cool for several minutes before gently removing them from the cupcake tin to cook completely.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2822903764/" title="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pie by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/2822903764_c4f85d054a.jpg" alt="Ground Cherry Cupcake Pie" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Ground cherry cupcake pies!</p>
<p>Again, you can use any fruit you like, but if you ever see ground cherries, definitely try them.  They&#8217;re also sometimes called cape gooseberries (though some people say it&#8217;s a different fruit in the same family), husk tomatoes (which usually refer to tomatillos&#8230;), goldenberries, and a host of other names.  Whatever they&#8217;re called, they should be small, sweet, and surprising.  Make a jam, dip them in chocolate, add them to salsa, or eat them raw.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Okay!  Seems like a lot of people find these growing nearby their homes. PLEASE don&#8217;t eat them unless you&#8217;re SURE they are okay to eat.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis">Wikipedia lists over 35 different plants in the Physalis genus</a>.  That&#8217;s a lot!  So there&#8217;s no guarantee the species that is growing near you is this same species I&#8217;ve written about.  Please be careful!!  Even if they are safe to eat, they might not taste the same. </font></p>
<p>If the people that live around you don&#8217;t tend to eat the fruits of the bushes you see, there might be a very good reason why.  Wild foraging can be dangerous, so please eat only ground cherries that you find at markets that have a reputation for, well, selling non-poisonous food.  Ha!</p>
