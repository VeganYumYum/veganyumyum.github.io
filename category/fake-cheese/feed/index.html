			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472514/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/7984472514_2e9a1776ce_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mushroom season! </p>
<p>I recently went on a wild edible plant walk here in the Boston area, and our guide told us that the best time to find mushrooms is between Labor Day and Columbus Day. We didn&#8217;t find any mushrooms on our walk, but he did get me thinking about making a recipe to show them off. I&#8217;m really interested in learning more about local wild, edible plants, so hopefully I&#8217;l be rooting around in the woods for some fungus soon.</p>
<p>And if you made the <a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">black pepper and cumin pickled carrots</a> from last week, here&#8217;s a recipe to try them with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473338/" title="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7984473338_48facfa999_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Any wild mushrooms will do for this recipe, but I picked out two of my favorites today: oyster mushrooms and chanterelles.  </p>
<p>Oyster mushrooms can be cultivated, so you are likely to find them outside of peak mushroom season. This also helps make them a bit more affordable than wild harvested mushrooms, but they are still many, many rungs up the ladder from the budget workhorse that is white button mushroom.  If you are interested, there are many resources online that describe how you can grow oyster mushrooms yourself, at home.</p>
<p>Chanterelles, however, do not cooperate with human cultivation. This means the mushrooms you see in the store were growing wild in a wood somewhere before they reached the shelves. The effort it takes to locate and collect them, their wonderfully complex flavor, and their perishable nature contribute to their price tag. </p>
<p>A note about using wild mushrooms: if you&#8217;re super squicky about eating a little dirt, this may not be the best food for you.  Washing mushrooms makes them soggy and sad.  I pick off anything that&#8217;s big enough to be picked off, and then chop it up and cook away without thinking too hard about what might be on them.  As long as the mushrooms are not slimy, don&#8217;t have any overly soft spots, aren&#8217;t hiding bugs, and don&#8217;t smell off&#8230; they are declared clean in my kitchen.  A little dirt from the middle of a forest won&#8217;t hurt you.</p>
<p>And if you found your own, just be careful!  Make sure you know what you have before you eat it.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Tostadas with Lime Creme Fraiche </strong><br />
<em>Makes Six Tostadas</em></p>
<p>Six Corn Tortillas<br />
Wild Mushroom Filling (recipe below)<br />
Lime Creme Fraiche (recipe below)<br />
1 Jalapeno Pepper, sliced thinly<br />
1 Small Bunch Fresh Cilantro Leaves, roughly chopped<br />
12 Pickled Carrot Sticks (<a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">recipe here</a>)<br />
1 Cup Daiya Vegan Cheese Shreds<br />
Oil </p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Filling</strong><br />
340g or 3/4lb Wild Mushrooms, weighed after trimming<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cumin<br />
1/2 tsp Dried Oregano<br />
1 tsp Earth Balance Spread or Oil<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p><strong>Lime Creme Fraiche</strong><br />
4 Tbs Tofutti Cream Cheese<br />
4 Tbs Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lime Juice</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473256/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7984473256_7cd4f2c24d_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopped Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the racks in your oven so one is in the middle and one is in the highest position.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
<p>Chop your mushrooms into a medium to small dice.  Add them to a dry skillet over medium high heat.  The mushrooms will begin to release moisture after a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473186/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7984473186_3448562707_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Wild Mushroom Filling"></a></p>
<p>After 3-4 minutes of cooking, add the salt, cumin and oregano. Keep an eye on the mushrooms and stir them every 10-15 seconds. Once most of the moisture has cooked out and they begin sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 7 minutes of total cooking time, add the Earth Balance and mix well.  Remove mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473120/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/7984473120_ee4d9234cc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Corn Tortillas"></a></p>
<p>Place six corn tortillas on a baking sheet.  Brush both sides very lightly with olive oil.  Put tortillas in the middle rack of the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes.  The edges of the tortilla should be beginning to curl and they should only barely have the slightest hint of color.  Remove from oven.</p>
<p>While the tortillas are baking, mix together the ingredients for the creme fraiche and refrigerate until ready to use.  It will take a lot of whisking to get the mixture smooth, but it will happen if you keep at it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984467283/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7984467283_24cb149b99_b.jpg" width="1000" height="808" alt="Mushroom, Jalapeno, Cilantro"></a></p>
<p>Once your tortillas are out of the oven, change the oven to the broil setting.  Get everything ready for assembly: sliced jalapenos, cilantro, carrot sticks, cheese, creme fraiche, mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472966/" title="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/7984472966_e8e2f67948_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>Evenly divide the mushroom mixture across the tortillas.  Top with a little vegan cheese.  Place in the oven, this time on the very top rack, to broil.  DO NOT WALK AWAY!  Watch them as they cook until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden brown.  Remove immediately.</p>
<p>Top each tostada with a dollop of the lime creme fraiche, some cilantro, a slice or two of jalapeno, and two picked carrot sticks.  Serve immediately.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3167685091/" title="VegYum Mac &amp; Cheeze by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1157/3167685091_7fb1d16ee8.jpg" width="450" alt="VegYum Mac &amp; Cheeze" /></a></p>
<p>I like trying different recipes for mac &#038; cheeze.  I make <a href="../../../2007/10/mac-and-cheese-cheeze-yeast/index.html">my own version</a> most often, but I&#8217;m always up for improving and changing my recipes when I can.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw that VegNews had an <a href="http://www.vegnews.com/web/articles/page.do?pageId=40&catId=10">interesting recipe</a>.  They use potatoes and carrots for the base (certainly healthier than my version) and cashews for the creaminess.  I&#8217;m a huge fan of cashews to make sauces rich and creamy.  So I made the recipe and was intrigued.  The texture was AWESOME, the color was good, it was a little on the salty side&#8230; overall really nice.  But it tasted a little <i>too</i> vegetable-y for my liking.</p>
<p>Now, vegan mac &#038; cheese doesn&#8217;t really taste 100% like the non-vegan stuff.  And that&#8217;s cool with me.  I just want it to taste good, and to satisfy a craving for a creamy baked pasta dish, you know?  My <a href="../../../2007/10/mac-and-cheese-cheeze-yeast/index.html">other post</a> has more of my thoughts on that.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3167678701/" title="VegYum Mac &amp; Cheeze by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1194/3167678701_d58d90710b.jpg" width="450" alt="VegYum Mac &amp; Cheeze" /></a></p>
<p>I decided to combine my recipe with with the VegNews recipe.  I kept the potato and the carrots for the base, added some of my favorite flavorings, and left out some of theirs.  For example, I took out the onion/garlic/shallots.  I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of those things to begin with, but I don&#8217;t ever remember having mac &#038; cheese taste like onions.  I know I just said <i>it doesn&#8217;t have to taste the same</i>, but those just aren&#8217;t the flavors I think of when I imagine mac &#038; cheese, you know?</p>
<p>Again, for easy link finding, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vegnews.com/web/articles/page.do?pageId=40&catId=10">VegNew&#8217;s awesome recipe</a>.  And without further ado, here&#8217;s my interpretation:</p>
<p><strong>VegYum Mac &#038; Cheeze</strong><br />
<em>Serves 3ish </em></p>
<p>8-10 Oz Whole Wheat Rotini<br />
2 Cups Steamed Broccoli Florets<br />
2 Pieces of Bread, toasted and ground to breadcrumbs</p>
<p>1 Cup Peeled, Finely Chopped Potatoes<br />
1/4 Cup Peeled, Finely Chopped Carrots<br />
1 Cup Water</p>
<p>1/3 Cup Raw Cashews<br />
1 Tbs Miso (any kind, I like red)<br />
1 Tbs Tahini<br />
1 Tbs Lemon Juice (sub: 2 tsp White Wine Vinegar)<br />
1/2 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/3 Cup Nutritional Yeast<br />
1 to 1 1/2 tsp Salt<br />
Black Pepper to taste<br />
Paprika for sprinkling</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350º</p>
<p>Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3167653941/" title="Whole Wheat Rotini by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1057/3167653941_b159cc6232.jpg" width="450" alt="Whole Wheat Rotini" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, steam broccoli and set aside.  I use my rice cooker.  Simply put the florets in the cooker with 2-3 Tbs of hot water and turn the cooker on.  Broccoli will be bright green and tender-crisp when done.  Don&#8217;t forget about it in there&#8211;it&#8217;ll finish cooking before the rice cooker clicks off, so if you forget about it, you&#8217;ll overcook your broccoli.  Mine takes less than 10 minutes to cook.</p>
<p>Make sure the carrots and potatoes are chopped very small; this will reduce the cooking time greatly.  Place the chopped potatoes and carrots in small sauce pan that has a lid.  Add the 1 cup of water.  Boil covered until tender, 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>While the potatoes and carrots are cooking, add the remaining ingredients to the blender (cashew, miso, lemon juice, mustard, earth balance, nut. yeast, salt and pepper).  Once potatoes and carrots are done cooking, add them and their cooking water to the blender as well.  Blend until VERY smooth.  If needed, add soymilk or water 1 Tbs at a time to thin.  Taste for seasoning.</p>
<p>Toast the bread and process into crumbs.</p>
<p>Toss the cooked pasta and broccoli with the sauce.  Place in a casserole dish and top with breadcrumbs, black pepper, and paprika.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3168502432/" title="Breadcrumbs by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1001/3168502432_f7962aa6fd.jpg" width="450" alt="Breadcrumbs" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 25 minute at 350º F until browned and bubbly.  Serve.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll make this version whenever I have potatoes handy.  It&#8217;s a tiny bit lighter than my other version, but it still has a lot of flavor and creaminess.  And it saves on soymilk, too!</p>

<p>There are innumerable recipes for vegan mac and cheese on the internet.  I&#8217;ve tried a lot of them.  Some of them simply call for &#8220;slices of soy cheese&#8221; and some vegetable stock to be mixed over pasta.  The majority, however, require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast">nutritional yeast</a>, and they usually also require making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">roux</a>.  The recipe below is from my upcoming cookbook, and it&#8217;s one of my favorites.   However, if you&#8217;ll indulge me for a moment, there are some things about vegan mac and cheeze I want to talk about.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m the first to admit &#8220;Mac and Yeast&#8221; doesn&#8217;t <i>quite</i> have the same ring to it.  That&#8217;s why I tend to call it &#8220;Mac and Cheeze&#8221;.  But I&#8217;m also the first to admit that these recipes, even the best of them, don&#8217;t really taste all that much like mac and cheese.  Some get much closer than others, and a lot are downright tasty.  But it&#8217;s not cheese.  Your omnivore or veggie friend/spouse/child may love it as much as or even more than the real stuff (if you&#8217;re lucky), but they probably love it on its own merits, not because they really can&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>But you know what?  It doesn&#8217;t have to taste exactly the same for me to love it.</p>
<p>A lot of people, myself included, are really interested in making vegan food that&#8217;s indistinguishable from the &#8220;real&#8221; thing.  It&#8217;s a fun challenge, and oftentimes, a challenge where you can really and truly be successful.  But there are many instances where you don&#8217;t create something identical, but what you <i>do</i> create is actually good.  Different, but yummy. While vegan mac and cheese doesn&#8217;t taste exactly like non-vegan mac and cheese, it <i>satisfies the same craving</i>.  It&#8217;s rich and creamy and salty and vaguely cheese-like.  It&#8217;s a yummy, thick creamy sauce to top noodles with.  </p>
<p>I think that sometimes it&#8217;s enough to satisfy your cravings with something similar, if you can&#8217;t find something identical.  After three years of being vegan, I don&#8217;t even crave mac and cheese anymore; I crave mac and yeast.</p>
<p>I think expectation is important with food.  If it looks like a grape, you expect it to taste like a grape.  If I hand you a glass of sparkling wine and tell you it&#8217;s gingerale, you might be put off when you take a sip.  You might even like wine, but you expected it to be, well, not wine.  If I say, &#8220;here, try this mac and cheese&#8221; and give you mac and yeast, you might be disappointed when you tasted it.  If you&#8217;ve never tried a mac and yeast recipe before, and you want to try this one, keep in mind that it doesn&#8217;t taste like cheese.  </p>
<p>It just tastes like yummy.  Well, it does to me and the vegans that tested the recipe for me!</p>
<p><strong>Mac and Cheeze</strong><br />
<em>Serves 2-3</em></p>
<p>1/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/4 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
2 1/2 Tbs Low Sodium Tamari or Soy Sauce<br />
1 Tbs Lemon Juice, fresh<br />
1 Tbs Sweet/White/Mellow Miso<br />
1 Tbs Tahini<br />
1 Tbs Tomato Paste (not sauce!)<br />
1 1/4 Cup Soy Milk<br />
1/3 Cup <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast">Nutritional Yeast</a><br />
1 Pinch Salt<br />
Black Pepper, to taste</p>
<p>Begin by heating a sauce pan and adding the earth balance.  Once melted, add flour and whisk vigorously until a smooth paste forms, called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">roux</a>.  Be careful not to add flour to a pan that is very hot, or your roux will be lumpy and you&#8217;ll need to start over.  If you mix in the flour as soon as the margarine is melted and you should avoid any problems.</p>
<p>To this paste, add tamari, lemon, miso, tahini, and tomato paste and whisk until well incorporated.  The mixture should still be paste-like.  Then slowly pour in the soymilk, whisking constantly, until it is completely incorporated.  Add the yeast and mix well.  Cook the mixture until it thickens, whisking often.  This should take approximately 5 minutes, but it&#8217;s flexible.  Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p><em>I like this the most baked.  Cook 3 cups of dry, small pasta (like elbows or shells or rotini) and toss with the finished cheezy sauce.  Add steamed broccoli (pictured) for a real treat.  Top with fresh breadcrumbs and bake at 400Âº for 25 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spilled so much ink so far (well, pixels) telling you that vegan cheese doesn&#8217;t taste like cheese, so I figured I&#8217;d close the entry with this:  vegan cheese that, to me, tastes like mother forkin&#8217; cheese!  It deserves an entire entry devoted to it, so I&#8217;ll just leave you with this until part two of my vegan cheese post:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about creating a tomato cream sauce for a while.  Actually, I wanted to make a vodka sauce, but I absolutely cannot stand vodka so we never have any in the house.  We do, however, continually have a veritable mountain of tomatoes in the kitchen.  Hello, Summer!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m beginning to get a huge crush on blender sauces.  Toss everything into the blender, whiz it up, heat it up and you&#8217;re done.  Between the blender sauce and the cappellini (aka angel hair) that cooks in 2-3 minutes, this is a lightning quick meal.  It&#8217;s fast and tasty, but not <i>exactly</i> healthy.  It&#8217;s a cream sauce!  What do you want from me?!</p>
<p>The sauce makes enough to coat two reasonable portions of pasta.  I say &#8220;reasonable&#8221; because when it comes to pasta, that&#8217;s not what I usually make.  I tend to go for &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; which usually ends in my husband and I complaining that are stomachs are going to absolutelyexploderightthisminute for an hour after eating.  If you make more than two lunch-sized pasta portions, you might want to make more sauce.  However, you don&#8217;t want to drown your cappellini.  This dish works best when it&#8217;s just lightly coated.</p>
<p><b>Cappellini in Fresh Tomato Cream Sauce</b><br />
<i>Serves Two</i></p>
<p>4 Small Tomatoes, quartered (about 2 Cups)<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/2 tsp Italian Herbs of your choice<br />
3 Tbs Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese<br />
1 Tbs Earth Balance<br />
1 Tbs Nutritional Yeast<br />
2-4 Cloves Garlic, optional</p>
<p>Heat well-salted water for you pasta.  </p>
<p>While heating, whiz your tomatoes around in your blender until it becomes as smooth as it&#8217;s going to get.  You should now have 1 cup of pink tomato sludge.  Add remaining ingredients and blend again until well combined.  Add mixture to a skillet over medium heat.  Once you start to see it bubble, you&#8217;re going to have to stir it fairly constantly so it doesn&#8217;t burn.  Use one of those fun rubber spatulas for this, I think it does the job best.</p>
<p>The sauce will be a light pink color when you start, but by the time it&#8217;s done it&#8217;ll be a rich, creamy orange.  You basically want to cook it until the tomatoes lose their raw taste, which shouldn&#8217;t take too long, about 10 minutes.  </p>
<p>Just before the sauce is done, add your pasta (broken in half for easier mixing with the sauce) to the water.  Check for doneness after 2 minutes.  Strain and add pasta directly to the sauce, right in the skillet there on the stove.  Mix well and serve immediately topped with lots of freshly cracked black pepper.</p>
<p>If this dish sits after the sauce is added, it&#8217;ll clump up a bit.  It&#8217;ll still be tasty, but the noodles will stick together.  It&#8217;s best if you time it so you can serve it immediately.  That should be pretty easy to do since the pasta cooks so quickly&#8211;just have it be the last part of your meal that you prepare.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really a shame about summer being so hot.  All of this wonderful produce available&#8211;my refrigerator is bursting at the bolts with our CSA veggies&#8211;and no desire to cook!  The thought of turning a gas burner on makes me wince, and I&#8217;d rather just pretend I don&#8217;t own an oven.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/999084302/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1031/999084302_b1c1106b17_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" width="240" height="160" alt="Organic Romas" /></a>We&#8217;ve been getting particularly beautiful tomatoes from <a href="http://redfirefarm.homestead.com/files/index.htm">Red Fire Farm</a>.  I have a confession, though.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of raw tomatoes.  I tend to eat around them.  They get picked out of sandwiches halfway through and blatantly ignored in salads.  I discovered that cooking them, even just slightly, makes a <i>world</i> of difference.</p>
<p>I LOVE slightly cooked tomatoes!  They are the perfect sandwich filler.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/999084420/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1033/999084420_186c31c2d6_m.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px"; width="240" height="160" alt="Tomato Basil Sandwich" /></a>And slightly cooked anything is good in this heat.  This is a light, summery sandwich I made for lunch.  It&#8217;s quick, easy, tasty, and takes advantage of the enormous amounts of summer tomatoes and basil we have at our disposal.  I&#8217;ve spread the sourdough with Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese, which is really one of the best vegan cheese products out there.  </p>

<i>Makes 1 Sammich</i></p>
<p>2-3 Roma Tomatoes, sliced lengthwise 1/4&#8243; thick<br />
1 Generous Pinch Salt<br />
1 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
1-2 Pinches Dried Italian Herbs<br />
1 Splash Balsamic Vinegar</p>
<p>2 Slices Sourdough<br />
Tofutti Cream Cheese<br />
4-5 Basil Leaves<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p>Heat a skillet over medium heat with oil and herbs.  Once hot, add tomatoes in one layer.  Give the pan a little shake and flip the tomatoes about.  Add salt.  Once they are beginning to soften, but not falling apart, add a splash of balsamic vinegar while shaking the pan.  Turn off heat.  This process should only take a few minutes.</p>
<p>Spread your bread with tofutti, add chopped basil and pepper.  Place tomatoes on top of that.  Grill sandwich with a weight on top.  If you&#8217;re not grilling, simply toast the bread first, then add tofutti and tomatoes.  Enjoy!  I&#8217;m going to go clean out my freezer so I can crawl inside it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running around trying to get a bank of recipes together for my cookbook project.  I made these today, and they would have been so good had they not melted my mouth.  Apparently jalapenos range from 2,500 to 10,000 scovilles, and I guess the peppers I picked up were closer to the latter.  I took one bite and had to fly into the kitchen to rip a chunk of bread off the nice loaf that Stewart bought earlier today.</p>
<p>I ended up eating the breading off, and scooping the filling out with my fingers.  Not very good table manners, but I wanted to eat them!  Next time I make these I should test the heat of the peppers before I begin filling them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m saving the recipe for the book/zine/whatever, but I can give you some tips on how to fill them:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/467471151/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/215/467471151_c4eae36268.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Trimming the Jalapenos" width="200" /></a>Use the tip of a sharp paring knife to cut a little door out of the side of the pepper.  Some recipes say to cut the entire pepper in half, but those recipes have sticky cheese in the middle to help the pepper glue itself back together.</p>
<p>Again, with the tip of your knife, try to remove as much of the seeds and membranes as possible.  They sort of hang down in the pepper in a cone, so if you cut the top and slide your knife down the sides, it should come out without too much fussing.  Remove any membranes from the little door, too, since you&#8217;ll be using that piece.</p>
<p>Oh, and leave the stems on!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/467471161/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/467471161_c75d954881.jpg" alt="Stuffing the Jalapenos" height="333" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>If you have a pastry bag, use that to fill the peppers.  If not, a ziplock with the corner cut off will work just as well.  You want to put enough filling in so that the door sticks to the pepper when you put it back in place.  If a little of the filling squishes out, just wipe it off and eat it, as long as no one is watching.</p>
<p>They should hold up well enough while you&#8217;re covering them in batter, and once they&#8217;re fried they&#8217;ll be sealed shut.  I need to go find some peppers that don&#8217;t want to kill me so I can make this again.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/457124085/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/178/457124085_19ca120f49.jpg" alt="Eggplant Napoleon" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>This recipe has a few surprises.  My requirements for dinner included using an eggplant, a red pepper, a stalk of broccoli, and some leftover tofu.  This turned out to be really fun and easy, despite the copious amounts of dishes it seemed to leave me with.  I&#8217;m sure I could have made it in a more organized fashion had I not been making it up as I went along.</p>
<p>The sauce you see is not tomato, it&#8217;s simply a single red bell pepper, pureed raw, with a pinch of salt.  I need to remind myself every once in a while that it&#8217;s not necessary to cook <em>every</em> single vegetable I want to eat.  It added a nice sweetness to balance out the salty roasted eggplant and sun-dried tomatoes in the couscous.  Yup!  That&#8217;s couscous in there, too!</p>
<p>Can you guess what the green bit on the top is?  Pureed, steamed broccoli!  This was such a fun way to eat broccoli, I want to buy more immediately so I can blend it up again and use it in odd places.  Forgive my enthusiasm, but there&#8217;s something about this light, bright green broccoli fluff that makes be a bit giddy.</p>
<p><strong>Eggplant Napoleon</strong><br />
<em>Serves four</em></p>
<p><em>Roasted Eggplant</em><br />
1 Eggplant, sliced into 3/8&#8243; thick rounds<br />
1/2 Cup Olive oil (I know!  It&#8217;s a lot!  Use less if you want!)<br />
1 tsp Salt</p>
<p><em>Sun-dried Tomato Couscous</em><br />
1/2 cup Couscous (french &#8211; the very tiny kind thats roughly shaped)<br />
1/4 Cup Sun-Dried Tomatoes, sliced in strips<br />
1 Cup Water, boiling</p>
<p><em>Sauce</em><br />
1 Red Bell Pepper, seeded and veined<br />
1 pinch to 1/4 tsp salt</p>
<p><em>Broccoli Fluff</em><br />
2 Cups Broccoli, rough chopped, steamed<br />
Pepper to taste</p>
<p>1/2 Recipe <a href="../../../../www.veganyumyum.com/2006/12/mushroom-and-sundried-tomato-lasagna/index.html">Tofu Ricotta</a><br />
1/2 Cup Toasted Pine Nuts</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 425Âº F.</p>
<p>Rub eggplant slices in salt and oil, place in one layer on a cookie sheet, and bake for 20 minutes.  Flip, bake for 10 more minutes, remove from oven.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place couscous and tomatoes in a small pot with a dribble of vegetable oil.  Toast over medium heat until fragrant, add boiling water, cover, reduce heat to  low.  After 10 minutes, turn off heat.  Puree your pepper in a food processor until very smooth.  Add salt to taste, set aside.  Steam broccoli, puree, add pepper to taste, set aside.  Toast pine nuts in a dry skillet.  Mix together tofu ricotta, heat in mircowave until hot, set aside.</p>
<p><em>To assemble</em></p>
<p>Place a bit of the pepper sauce in the middle of the plate.  Add a slice of eggplant on top of that.  Add a layer of tofu ricotta and a layer of broccoli fluff.  Add another slice of eggplant.  Add couscous and broccoli.  Add the last slice of eggplant and top with tofu and broccoli.  Garnish with toasted pine nuts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kind of embarrassed, because I&#8217;m excited.  I&#8217;m excited about rice and beans.  Who gets excited about rice and beans?</p>
<p>Me, apparently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with the dish recently.  Perhaps you&#8217;ve seen or tried the <a href="../../../wp-admin/rainbow%20rice%20and%20beans/index.html">Rainbow Rice and Beans</a>, our standard, or the <a href="../../../2007/03/tahini-lemon-rice-and-beans/index.html">Tahini Rice and Beans</a>.  Well, two rice and beans recipes are simply not enough!  I must have more ways to eat rice and beans, so people can laugh at me for being a vegan and eating rice and beans all day long.</p>
<p>I loved the way this dish turned out.  I especially love the lemon zest on top.  It really does something magical.  But I must warn you, I think a <a href="http://us.microplane.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=4">microplane grater</a> is absolutely necessary.  A friend of mine bought me on as a present recently, and <strong>my word</strong>.  It makes the finest, lightest, fluffiest zest I&#8217;ve ever had.  It practically melts in your mouth.  I almost want to tell you to <em>skip the zest altogether</em> if you don&#8217;t have a grater like this.  Is that ridiculous?</p>
<p><strong>Italian Rice and Beans</strong><br />
<em>Serves One Hearty Meal</em></p>
<p>1/2 Cup Brown Rice, uncooked<br />
1/2 Can Great Northern Beans, rinsed and drained<br />
1/4 Cup Oil Packed Sun-Dried Tomatoes, sliced into strips<br />
1/4 Cup Pine Nuts<br />
1 Large Handful Baby Spinach<br />
1 tsp Balsamic Vinegar<br />
1/4 tsp Kosher Salt<br />
1-2 tsp Italian Herbs of your choice, (basil, oregano, marjoram, rosemary, etc)<br />
Zest from 1/2 Organic Lemon<br />
Almond Cheesy Sprinkles, optional</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/445048595/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/445048595_841cc1cc78_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Sauteing Pine Nuts, Herbs, and Sundried Tomatoes" height="160" width="240" /></a>Start your rice, I use a rice cooker.  When nearly finished (or actually finished), heat 3 Tbs of olive oil in a saut&eacute; pan over medium heat.  Add herbs, tomatoes, and pine nuts.  When pine nuts start to turn golden brown, add the beans.  Toss gently, trying your best to keep the beans whole.  Add salt and vinegar, stir gently.  Turn down heat to low.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/445048629/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/445048629_35db240e1f_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Wilting Spinach with Hot Rice" height="160" width="240" /></a>Place spinach <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/445048601/">in one layer on top</a> of the beans.  Place hot, steaming rice over spinach and leave for 30 seconds or so, until you see the spinach start to wilt.  Mix gently and plate.</p>
<p>Grate lemon zest on top of rice and beans, and finish with a sprinkle of almond cheesy sprinkles if desired.  I ate lunch alone today, so I only made enough for me.  I&#8217;ll test the recipe in bigger portions sometime soon, but if you want to double it before then, keep an eye on the vinegar and salt levels &#8211; they may not double exactly.</p>

<p>This is another test recipe for the <a href="http://www.theppk.com/">Post Punk Kitchen&#8217;s</a> forthcoming cookbook, Veganomicon.  Her first book, Vegan with a Vengeance, is my all-time favorite cookbook.  I can tell you honestly that this one will be every bit as useful, dependable, and amazing as the first.  I swear they&#8217;re not paying me to promote the books.  They&#8217;re just all so great!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/394700631/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/143/394700631_042995b5fc_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Eggplant Spinach Rollatini, pre-bake" height="180" width="240" /></a>This recipe, man, I can&#8217;t even tell you how much I liked it.  It&#8217;s basically breaded, fried eggplant, stuffed with tastiness and tofu ricotta, then smothered with a delicious marinara sauce.  I&#8217;d buy the cookbook for this recipe alone.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of people who dislike eggplant, but I wonder how many of them have tried it fried or baked with olive oil.  Eggplant really takse on a different character when cooked this way &#8211; it&#8217;s really quite divine.  It&#8217;s buttery, soft,  almost creamy, but it does take a lot of oil to get it that way.  I think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been making some other test recipes that I haven&#8217;t told you about yet.  Here is a dessert and a quick bread:</p>
<p>Tea Poached Pears<br />

<p>I promise you, this is the last time I&#8217;ll subject you to risotto for a while.  <a href="../../../2007/01/notso-buco-with-saffron-rosemary/index.html">Baked risotto</a> is just <em>such</em> a revelation.  I had to try it again with a tomato base.  I also had an eggplant and some mushrooms to use, and didn&#8217;t feel like being all that creative.  Stewart and I were hungry and it wasn&#8217;t time for me to start playing around in the kitchen without a plan.  Risotto?  In a half hour?  Done.</p>
