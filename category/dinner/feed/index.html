<p>It&#8217;s mushroom season! </p>
<p>I recently went on a wild edible plant walk here in the Boston area, and our guide told us that the best time to find mushrooms is between Labor Day and Columbus Day. We didn&#8217;t find any mushrooms on our walk, but he did get me thinking about making a recipe to show them off. I&#8217;m really interested in learning more about local wild, edible plants, so hopefully I&#8217;l be rooting around in the woods for some fungus soon.</p>
<p>And if you made the <a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">black pepper and cumin pickled carrots</a> from last week, here&#8217;s a recipe to try them with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473338/" title="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7984473338_48facfa999_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Oyster and Chanterelle Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Any wild mushrooms will do for this recipe, but I picked out two of my favorites today: oyster mushrooms and chanterelles.  </p>
<p>Oyster mushrooms can be cultivated, so you are likely to find them outside of peak mushroom season. This also helps make them a bit more affordable than wild harvested mushrooms, but they are still many, many rungs up the ladder from the budget workhorse that is white button mushroom.  If you are interested, there are many resources online that describe how you can grow oyster mushrooms yourself, at home.</p>
<p>Chanterelles, however, do not cooperate with human cultivation. This means the mushrooms you see in the store were growing wild in a wood somewhere before they reached the shelves. The effort it takes to locate and collect them, their wonderfully complex flavor, and their perishable nature contribute to their price tag. </p>
<p>A note about using wild mushrooms: if you&#8217;re super squicky about eating a little dirt, this may not be the best food for you.  Washing mushrooms makes them soggy and sad.  I pick off anything that&#8217;s big enough to be picked off, and then chop it up and cook away without thinking too hard about what might be on them.  As long as the mushrooms are not slimy, don&#8217;t have any overly soft spots, aren&#8217;t hiding bugs, and don&#8217;t smell off&#8230; they are declared clean in my kitchen.  A little dirt from the middle of a forest won&#8217;t hurt you.</p>
<p>And if you found your own, just be careful!  Make sure you know what you have before you eat it.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Tostadas with Lime Creme Fraiche </strong><br />
<em>Makes Six Tostadas</em></p>
<p>Six Corn Tortillas<br />
Wild Mushroom Filling (recipe below)<br />
Lime Creme Fraiche (recipe below)<br />
1 Jalapeno Pepper, sliced thinly<br />
1 Small Bunch Fresh Cilantro Leaves, roughly chopped<br />
12 Pickled Carrot Sticks (<a href="../../../2012/09/black-pepper-and-cumin-pickled-carrots/index.html">recipe here</a>)<br />
1 Cup Daiya Vegan Cheese Shreds<br />
Oil </p>
<p><strong>Wild Mushroom Filling</strong><br />
340g or 3/4lb Wild Mushrooms, weighed after trimming<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Ground Cumin<br />
1/2 tsp Dried Oregano<br />
1 tsp Earth Balance Spread or Oil<br />
Black Pepper</p>
<p><strong>Lime Creme Fraiche</strong><br />
4 Tbs Tofutti Cream Cheese<br />
4 Tbs Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lime Juice</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473256/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7984473256_7cd4f2c24d_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Chopped Mushrooms"></a></p>
<p>Arrange the racks in your oven so one is in the middle and one is in the highest position.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
<p>Chop your mushrooms into a medium to small dice.  Add them to a dry skillet over medium high heat.  The mushrooms will begin to release moisture after a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473186/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7984473186_3448562707_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Wild Mushroom Filling"></a></p>
<p>After 3-4 minutes of cooking, add the salt, cumin and oregano. Keep an eye on the mushrooms and stir them every 10-15 seconds. Once most of the moisture has cooked out and they begin sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 7 minutes of total cooking time, add the Earth Balance and mix well.  Remove mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984473120/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/7984473120_ee4d9234cc_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Corn Tortillas"></a></p>
<p>Place six corn tortillas on a baking sheet.  Brush both sides very lightly with olive oil.  Put tortillas in the middle rack of the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes.  The edges of the tortilla should be beginning to curl and they should only barely have the slightest hint of color.  Remove from oven.</p>
<p>While the tortillas are baking, mix together the ingredients for the creme fraiche and refrigerate until ready to use.  It will take a lot of whisking to get the mixture smooth, but it will happen if you keep at it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984467283/" ><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7984467283_24cb149b99_b.jpg" width="1000" height="808" alt="Mushroom, Jalapeno, Cilantro"></a></p>
<p>Once your tortillas are out of the oven, change the oven to the broil setting.  Get everything ready for assembly: sliced jalapenos, cilantro, carrot sticks, cheese, creme fraiche, mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/7984472966/" title="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/7984472966_e8e2f67948_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Making Wild Mushroom Tostadas"></a></p>
<p>Evenly divide the mushroom mixture across the tortillas.  Top with a little vegan cheese.  Place in the oven, this time on the very top rack, to broil.  DO NOT WALK AWAY!  Watch them as they cook until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden brown.  Remove immediately.</p>
<p>Top each tostada with a dollop of the lime creme fraiche, some cilantro, a slice or two of jalapeno, and two picked carrot sticks.  Serve immediately.</p>

<p>Yes, I know.  It&#8217;s a salad.  </p>
<p>Who wants to go to a vegan website and see a recipe for salad?  I keep salads to an absolute minimum around here.  So when one does show up, it&#8217;s a freakin&#8217; delicious salad.  </p>
<p>And this one is definitely freakin&#8217; delicious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the idea of an avocado based salad dressing kicking around in my head for the last few days, and an avocado kicking around my kitchen counter.  This salad is easy to throw together, and is a great entree salad, or a side salad for a dinner party or some such get-together.</p>
<p>The dressing is rich, and despite the title, is pretty damn tasty even without the added wasabi.  You have my permission to leave the wasabi powder out altogether if you don&#8217;t like it or can&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if my wasabi powder is old and has lost its kick, or if you need a massive amount of it to make things spicy (anyone with experience want to weigh in?), but this dressing was as mild as the day is long.  It added a great flavor, but no heat.  You may wish to add in your own wasabi powder slowly, tasting as you go, just in case yours is spicy.</p>
<p>The other ingredients are simple but flavorful as well.  Pan-fried wasabi-soy chickpeas, sauteed broccoli, toasted almonds, and shredded carrots.  I find this mixture goes particularly well together, adding crunch, sweetness, protein, and color.  And they all pair wonderfully with the dressing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4309217553/" title="Avocado Wasabi Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4309217553_1ddcb13eaf.jpg" width="450" alt="Avocado Wasabi Salad" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of the dressing, it&#8217;s pretty ugly stuff.  This isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re going to want to serve on the side for your guests.  Toss it with the lettuce and then serve it.  Just trust me on this one.  You&#8217;ll see when you make it.  </p>
<p><strong>Avocado Wasabi Salad</strong><br />
<em>Serves 4-6</em></p>
<p>Greens of your choice for 4-6 people<br />
1 Carrot, shredded<br />
2 tsp Vegetable Oil, divided<br />
1/2 to 3/4 Cup Broccoli, chopped small<br />
1/3 Cup Toasted Slivered Almonds<br />
1 Recipe Wasabi Chickpeas, below<br />
1 Recipe Avocado Wasabi dressing, below<br />
Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</p>
<p><em>Wasabi-Tamari Chickpeas</em><br />
1 tsp Oil<br />
1 Cup Chickpeas<br />
1 tsp Wasabi Powder<br />
1/2 tsp Sugar<br />
1 Tbs Low Sodium Tamari/Soy Sauce</p>
<p><em>Avocado Wasabi Dressing</em><br />
1 Ripe Avocado, diced<br />
2 tsp White Wine Vinegar<br />
3 Tbs Hummus, plain or garlic<br />
1 tsp Stoneground Mustard<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
2 tsp Wasabi Powder<br />
1/4 to 1/3 Cup Vegetable oil</p>
<p>Begin by whisking the dressing ingredients together, except for the oil.  Whisk until smooth.  If your avocado isn&#8217;t super ripe, you may wish to blend the dressing in a food processor.  Slowly add oil until emulsified and the dressing is smooth, refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<p>Toast your almonds in a dry pan over medium heat if they are not already toasted.  Set aside.</p>
<p>In the same pan, add 1 tsp of oil and add broccoli.  Sautee over high heat until the broccoli is beginning to color in spots and is bright green, but still tender-crisp.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside.</p>
<p>Add the second teaspoon of oil to the same pan and add the chickpeas.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Cook the chickpeas until they are golden on all sides, using a spatula to loosen them as necessary, but don&#8217;t worry if they stick a little.  Add the wasabi powder, sugar, and tamari and stir well.  Remove from pan and set aside.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, add your salad greens.  Add the broccoli, 3/4 of the chickpeas, 3/4 of the almonds, and 3/4 of the carrots.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Plate the salad, and garnish the top with the remaining chickpeas, almonds and carrots.  Crack fresh black pepper over the top.  Serve immediately.  </p>
<p>If you are serving the salad later, do not add the dressing until the last minute.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; I have a new &#8220;like&#8221; button down there over the comments if you want to heart a recipe without commenting. :)  And if you&#8217;re interested in what I&#8217;m cooking, and what us in line for the blog, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/VeganYumYum/122044796539?ref=nf">become a fan on facebook</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285956/" title="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2747/4291285956_4ba2fc6492_o.jpg" width="450" alt="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki" /></a></p>
<p>So how about we get this yummy vegan train back up and running again?  Let&#8217;s talk teriyaki.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a real teriyaki sauce, but it&#8217;s definitely inspired by one.  Teriyaki sauce is one of those things that is really easy to make at home successfully, so if you&#8217;ve been going without or buying expensive bottles of the stuff, you can stop!  It literally has three ingredients, but you can obviously get fancier with it if you like.  </p>
<p>Soy Sauce<br />
Sugar<br />
Mirin or Sake</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, people.  Mix, reduce over heat, and eat up.</p>
<p>So this sauce isn&#8217;t really a teriyaki sauce because I use rice vinegar instead of mirin.  Mirin is a sweet, thick rice wine that&#8217;s very commonly used in Japanese cooking, but I happen to be out of it at the moment.  I&#8217;ve found that rice vinegar makes a good substitute (though not 1:1, necessarily), and can be much easier to find in supermarkets.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is a common substitution or not, and perhaps people familiar with Japanese cooking would screw up their face at the idea, but it works. And it&#8217;s tasty.  So there you have it.</p>
<p>I also added clementine zest and juice to my teriyaki sauce.  I love the sweetness and the bright citrus note it adds to the dish.  I think any citrus you have would work here, and you can even leave it out altogether if you like (sub water for the juice, add a little more sugar if you like). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285482/" title="Clementine Zest by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4291285482_4d2a6e1b8f.jpg" width="450" alt="Clementine Zest" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s winter, and it&#8217;s high season for clementines.  If you haven&#8217;t already picked up one of those enticing wooden crates full of them at the supermarket, I encourage you to do so.  They are sweet, seedless, easy to peel, and all-around amazing.  You will finish the entire crate, I promise you.  And if not, now you have a recipe to use some of them in.  And if you still have leftovers, send them to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285136/" title="Sushi Rice by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2802/4291285136_1c8878651a.jpg" width="450" alt="Sushi Rice" /></a></p>
<p>As with most of my recipes, this one is pretty flexible.  I used broccolini because I LOVE the stuff, but regular broccoli, asparagus, or your favorite veggie will stand in nicely.  I served this with sushi rice, but noodles would be welcome.  The seitan is perfect here, but tofu or even tempeh would be lovely as well.  Orange juice will cover for clementine.  This is a great recipe to adapt to use your favorite ingredients, or at least the ones you have sitting in your fridge at the moment.</p>
<p>If you like, add some sesame oil, or garlic, or ginger to the sauce.  I love it how it is, and appreciate its simplicity, but this sauce can be used more as a base sauce you can embellish any which way you like. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4291285728/" title="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4291285728_16e910367f.jpg" width="450" alt="Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Seitan and Broccolini with Clementine Teriyaki</strong><br />
<em>Serves Two</em></p>
<p>8 Ounces Sliced Seitan (I use West Soy brand)<br />
1 Cup Sushi RIce<br />
6-8 Stalks of Broccolini<br />
2 Clementines<br />
1 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nanami-Togarashi-Japanese-Mixed-Pepper/dp/B000FL1U80">Japanese Seven Spice</a>, optional</p>
<p><em>Clementine Teriyaki Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Low Sodium Tamari<br />
1/3 Cup Light Brown Sugar<br />
1/3 Cup Fresh Clementine Juice<br />
1/4 Cup + 1 Tbs Rice Vinegar<br />
1/4 Cup Water<br />
Zest from 1 Clementine</p>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in cool water and drain.  Cook in your rice cooker or on the stove according to package directions, but 1 cup of sushi rice is usually cooked in 1 1/4 cups of water.  Allow to cook completely and steam for 5-10 minutes off the heat while you are preparing the rest of the meal.  Total cooking time for the rice will be around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small pan let it go at a lively simmer for 20 minutes, until reduced and slightly thick.  The sauce will NOT be super thick when it is hot.  It will very slightly cover the back of a spoon and look syrupy, but it&#8217;s not going to be thick until it cools, so don&#8217;t worry if it seems runny.  At the end of the cooking you should see large, excited bubbles (this is the sugar caramelizing), so if you don&#8217;t see those, keep cooking.  Once the sauce is done, it&#8217;ll taste good but pretty strong.  Set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/4290545587/" title="Sliced Seitan by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4290545587_dfa5901b96.jpg" width="450" alt="Sliced Seitan" /></a></p>
<p>While the sauce and the rice are cooking, prepare your seitan and broccolini.  Slice the seitan into 1/8&#8243; thick medallions, or something similar.  I usually don&#8217;t prep broccolini any more than rinsing it and chopping off the ends, but if the stalks are particularly thick, you may wish to half them lengthwise.  This shouldn&#8217;t be the case with most bunches you find in the store, however.</p>
<p>Heat a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium high heat.  Add the seitan and let brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove to a bowl, turn up the heat to high, and add broccolini in one layer.  Once you get color on one side, flip, reduce heat to low, and cover the pan to finish the cooking, another 2-3 minutes.  The broccolini should be bright green and cooked to a tender-crisp.  </p>
<p>Once you are ready to serve, add the seitan to the pan with the broccolini.  Drizze enough teriyaki sauce in to coat everything.  Beware, if the pan is too hot you risk burning your sauce, so take good care here.  Once everything is heated and covered in a nice glaze, serve immediately with the sushi rice.  Top with seven spice if you like a little heat.</p>
<p>This sauce is strong so you just need enough to coat &#8212; save any extra for a future meal. </p>

<p>Alright, are you ready for the first recipe preview from the VYY cookbook?</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite recipes in the book.  I make it almost once a week.  It&#8217;s the perfect creamy pasta sauce when you&#8217;re feeling like alfredo.  It&#8217;s also a great sauce for casseroles, over steamed veggies, on top of lasagna &#8212; wherever you want a basic creamy sauce.  So not only is it really versatile, but it&#8217;s also really quick!</p>
<p>The whole sauce is made in a blender, so the faster you can toss ingredients into a blender, the faster it&#8217;s done.  This also makes it super easy for additions.  Recently I&#8217;ve been adding whole roasted red peppers (the kind they sell water-packed in jars).</p>
<p><strong>Hurry Up Alfredo</strong><br />
<em>Makes 2-3 Servings</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Soymilk<br />
1/3 Cup Raw, Unsalted Cashews<br />
1/4 Cup Nutritional Yeast<br />
3 Tbs Low-Sodium Tamari or Soy Sauce<br />
2 Tbs Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1 Tbs Tahini<br />
1 Tbs Fresh Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/2 tsp Paprika (smoked is awesome)<br />
1 Pinch Nutmeg<br />
2-4 Cloves of Garlic, optional<br />
Black pepper, to taste</p>
<p>Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth.  This may work best in a high-speed blender (like a Vita-Mix), but you can definitely make it in a regular blender.  Just blend extra-long, or perhaps strain if if you want it perfectly smooth.  Tiny bits of cashews won&#8217;t hurt anyone though!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re making this sauce for pasta, drain the pasta and return it to the hot empty pan.  Pour the sauce over, place on medium heat, and stir until heated through.  Serve with lots of fresh cracked black pepper.  I love it with steamed broccoli added in!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105439/" title="BLT Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2566/3743105439_04878091ec.jpg" width="450" alt="BLT Salad" /></a></p>
<p>This salad isn&#8217;t exactly&#8230; healthy.  What it <i>is</i>, exactly, is delicious.  And it has a surprise.  There&#8217;s no lettuce.  The greens are baby spinach, and raw kale.</p>
<p>Stay with me, here!</p>
<p>Yes, I said raw kale.  I know you are thinking that I have finally gone off the vegan deep end.  But I swear, the water is nice!</p>
<p>You can eat raw kale, too, if you pay attention to these three things: the kind, the cut, and the preparation.  Follow these three steps and I swear you&#8217;ll be eating your kale raw and loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Kind</strong><br />
The first step is finding the right kind of kale.  Lacinato kale is perfectly suited to eating raw.  I find that it&#8217;s thinner and more tender than the other varieties, but sadly, it&#8217;s not nearly as common.  Look for long, thin, flat leaves that are slightly dimpled.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897286/" title="Lacinato Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3420/3743897286_bc3b21d4ce.jpg" width="450" alt="Lacinato Kale" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not always obvious what the best cut is for a certain dish.  Small, thin strips of kale is integral for this salad, or any meal where the kale is served raw or lightly cooked.  When the kale is cut this way, the dressing has a much easier time tenderizing the kale without having to cook it.  Larger pieces of kale would be much harder to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />
With regular lettuce, you wait to add the dressing until just before serving.  Otherwise the salt and acid in the dressing starts to break down the fresh, crisp greens, leaving you with a soggy mess.  With a kale salad, this is to your advantage!  Dress the salad ahead of time and refrigerate it for a bit.  The dressing will soften up the kale just the right amount.  Plus, the addition of a creamy dressing compliments kale&#8217;s flavors nicely.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897708/" title="BLT Salad by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3743897708_8ebeec3256.jpg" width="450" alt="BLT Salad" /></a></p>
<p>There are many fake bacon products out there.  My favorite is what I&#8217;ve used in this recipe, Lightlife&#8217;s Smoky Tempeh Strips.  While the package says &#8220;Fakin&#8217; Bacon&#8221; I find that it&#8217;s not at all like what I remember of the real thing, but I still like it.  It&#8217;s smoky and salty and tangy, and it&#8217;s AWESOME in this salad (or on sandwiches).  But as awesome as it is, bacon it is not.  If you&#8217;re looking for something that more closely approximates the texture and flavor of bacon, there are probably other brands out there, but I haven&#8217;t found one that I like.</p>
<p>One last note: due to the sturdy nature of kale, this is the perfect picnic and pot luck salad.  You can throw it together ahead of time and it&#8217;ll be perky and crisp when you get around to serving it.  If you&#8217;re looking for a side dish that can stand up to summer entertaining, this recipe is a good bet.</p>
<p><strong>BLT Salad</strong><br />
<em>4-6 Side Salads</em></p>
<p>1 Head Lacinato Kale (aka Tuscan or Dinosaur Kale)*<br />
1 Package <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=tempeh_smokystrips">Lightelife Organic Smoky Tempeh Strips</a>**<br />
2 Tbs Peanut Oil, divided<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Baby Spinach, Packed<br />
1 to 1 1/2 Cups Sweet Cherry Tomatoes (about 25)</p>
<p><em>Dressing</em><br />
1/4 Cup Vegenaise Mayo<br />
1 tsp Dijon Mustard<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Agave Nectar<br />
Freshly Ground Black Pepper</p>
<p><em>*You can also use regular lettuce if you like, just make sure not to add the dressing until just before serving.</em></p>
<p><em>**Sub baked tofu, another mock bacon, or my <a href="../../../2008/07/smokey-miso-tofu/index.html">Smoky Miso Tofu</a>.</em></p>
<p>Wash and dry kale. Using kitchen shears (or a knife, or your fingers), remove and discard the center stem from each leaf.  I find scissors makes the job quick and easy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105005/" title="Deveining Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3743105005_b7af46a4b0.jpg" width="450" alt="Deveining Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the kale leaves on top of each other and slice into thin strips with a sharp knife:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743105089/" title="Chopping Kale by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3743105089_379527acb3.jpg" width="450" alt="Chopping Kale" /></a></p>
<p>Place the cut kale into a large bowl.  Whisk the dressing together and toss with the kale until evenly coated.  If you are using regular lettuce, keep the dressing separate until just before serving.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, longer is no problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prepare the &#8220;bacon.&#8221;  Slice the tempeh strips into thin, small pieces, and pan-fry in 1 Tbs peanut oil for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp on the edges.  Drain on a paper towel and set aside:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3743897594/" title="Fakin' Bacon (tempeh) by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2487/3743897594_8e5d19e925.jpg" width="450" alt="Fakin' Bacon (tempeh)" /></a></p>
<p>Next, add another tablespoon of peanut oil to the same pan you cooked the bacon in (don&#8217;t wash it out!).  Cook the tomatoes with 1/4 tsp salt for 3 minutes over high heat, or until beginning to soften and the juices are starting to come out.  Remove to a bowl, with juices, and set aside.</p>
<p><strong>Assembling the salad</strong></p>
<p>Once you are ready to serve the salad, chop up the baby spinach and toss it with the kale, making sure everything is now covered in dressing.  If you are using regular lettuce, mix in the dressing now.  Add 3/4 of the bacon and the tomatoes and toss again.  Plate, topping the salad with the rest of the bacon and some freshly cracked black pepper.  Serve.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3570390395/" title="Chili Almond Asparagus by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3570390395_287a1c8c43.jpg" width="450" alt="Chili Almond Asparagus" /></a></p>
<p>Sorry for the absence, I got pretty sick and needed to take some time off from&#8230; everything.  Before asparagus season passes us by (it will be gone before you know it!), I thought I&#8217;d offer up this simple but flavorful and beautiful side dish.</p>
<p>There are lots of times where I&#8217;d like to make a little side dish, but I just don&#8217;t want to work too hard at it.  Here&#8217;s a great recipe for just such an occasion.  It&#8217;s fancy enough for company, but easy enough for everyday dinner.  I first got the idea when I tossed some asparagus in a powdered faux-chicken soup stock and then roasted them.  It gave the asparagus a lovely flavor, while helping the spears get golden brown and slightly crispy.  </p>
<p>The bare-bones version of this recipe is just tossing the asparagus in oil, a little soup stock powder, and roasting until tender.  This version here is the next-step, adding just a few ingredients for a lot more flavor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3570390369/" title="Chili Almond Asparagus by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3570390369_21437b2e3d.jpg" width="450" alt="Chili Almond Asparagus" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Chili Almond Asparagus</strong><br />
<em>Serves two to four as a side</em></p>
<p>1/4 Cup Sliced Almonds, roughly crushed and divided<br />
1 Tbs Powdered Soup Stock (I used Bill&#8217;s Chik&#8217;nish Seasoning)<br />
2 tsp Red Chili Flakes<br />
1 lb Asparagus Spears, trimmed<br />
2 Carrots, peeled<br />
2 tsp Peanut Oil (or any kind you like)<br />
1 tsp Toasted Sesame Oil (or any other kind)<br />
Fresh Zest and juice of 1 Lemon</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450º F.</p>
<p>Roughly crush the almonds so that most are ground fairly fine, but there are some larger pieces of almonds left in the mix.  Mix together 1/2 of the ground almonds, the soup stock powder, and the chili flakes.</p>
<p>Trim the carrots to the same length, roughly, as the asparagus spears.  Half the carrots lengthwise, then quarter them, and continue cutting each piece lengthwise until you have lots of long, flexible, thin strips of carrots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3571199630/" title="Asparagus and Carrots by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3014/3571199630_75f7521a26.jpg" width="450" alt="Asparagus and Carrots" /></a></p>
<p>In a large bowl, toss the carrots and the asparagus spears in the oils.  Sprinkle the almond seasoning over the asparagus and carrots and toss well, making sure the coating sticks to the veggies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3571199698/" title="Chili Almond Seasoning by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3599/3571199698_6239620c3d.jpg" width="450" alt="Chili Almond Seasoning" /></a></p>
<p>Arrange the veggies in one layer on a parchment covered baking sheet.  If there is any seasoning left in the bowl, scrape it onto the veggies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3571199748/" title="Before roasting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3571199748_c6d96748da.jpg" width="450" alt="Before roasting" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the veggies are tender and starting to color.  Finish under the broiler for a few minutes (watching it, it&#8217;ll burn easily) until brown and crispy in places.</p>
<p>Top with the remaining almond pieces, lemon zest, and season with a sprinkle of lemon juice if desired.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3570390435/" title="Chili Almond Asparagus by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3570390435_0e532ca7ca.jpg" width="450" alt="Chili Almond Asparagus" /></a></p>
<p>This is best served hot/warm.  The asparagus should be cooked through and tender, but not mushy.  It&#8217;s a perfect compliment to any spring dinner or lunch.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848517/" title="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3528848517_ba3b8a03fc.jpg" width="450" alt="Rustic Bread and Eggplant Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>My husband and I have been watching The Sopranos recently (yes, I&#8217;m apparently 10 years behind the curve here), and I can only listen to the characters talk about manicotti and baked ziti so many times before I get a serious craving for some Italian food.  It got me thinking to a public television cooking show I saw a while ago, <a href="http://www.lidiasitaly.com/tv-show">Lidia&#8217;s Italy</a>.  I remember she made a lasagna that used bread instead of noodles, and it struck me as brilliant.  </p>
<p>I know making pasta isn&#8217;t hard, but there&#8217;s something about boiling lasagna noodles that is a huge pain in the ass.  They&#8217;re huge, you must not over cook them, you have to prevent them from sticking to each other after draining&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;m just lazy, but the idea of using bread really caught my attention.  Of course, I couldn&#8217;t find Lydia&#8217;s recipe to go from, so this version is totally made up by me.  But not only do I want to credit her for general inspiration, she also has an Italian cooking show, so she gives my crazy bread lasagna some legitimacy.  Maybe.  Shhh.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to use is a loaf of pre-sliced, crusty sourdough.  I know I recommend sourdough for everything, but really, it&#8217;s awesome in this dish.  You want the favor, of course, but you also want a sturdy &#8220;artisan&#8221; type bread that won&#8217;t fall apart in the oven.  This isn&#8217;t a job for sliced sandwich bread.  It&#8217;s best with bread that is even perhaps a little stale.  Look for a quality sliced loaf in the day old section of your grocer and save a buck or two.</p>
<p>You can put absolutely anything in this lasagna.  I picked eggplants because I had three of them.  I think they are lovely in this, so I recommend them, but really, stuff this with whatever you like or whatever is handy.</p>
<p><strong>Rustic Bread &#038; Eggplant Lasagna</strong><br />
<em>Serves 9-12</em></p>
<p>3 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
4-6 Cloves Garlic, minced (optional)<br />
2 28 oz Cans Organic Tomatoes, blended<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
4 tsp Dried Italian Herbs<br />
Olive Oil, for drizzling<br />
2-3 Medium Eggplants, peeled<br />
8-10 Large Slices of Sourdough Bread<br />
1 Cup Breadcrumbs (or 2 more pieces of bread for toasting and food processing)<br />
1-2 Large, Ripe Tomatoes, fresh, for garnish<br />
Basil, for garnish</p>
<p>In a very large skillet with high sides, or a sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.  Sweat the garlic for 1-2 minutes, then add tomatoes, salt, and herbs.  Cook for 30 minutes (bubbling), stirring occasionally.  Invert a mesh strainer over the top of the pan to prevent splatter, if desired.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400º F.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prep two baking sheets with parchment paper.  Peel the eggplants by slicing off the top and bottom and using the cut edge to start your vegetable peeler.  Holding the eggplant vertically, cut the eggplants into 1/2 inch slices.  Arrange in one layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and drizzle liberally with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660042/" title="Eggplant before roasting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/3529660042_3b549a2597.jpg" width="450" alt="Eggplant before roasting" /></a></p>
<p>Bake eggplant for 30-40 minutes at 400º, turning once, until very, very soft and browned in some places.</p>
<p>Spray both sides of each slice of bread with spray oil and &#8220;grill&#8221; in a hot skillet until browned on both sides.  You can also simply toast the bread, but I think you get more flavor with grilling.</p>
<p>In a large baking dish (a lasagna dish), spread 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce.  Line the bottom of the dish with bread, filling as many as the gaps as possible without overlapping.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660088/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2058/3529660088_c32010c4dc.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Place half of the eggplant on top of the bread, followed by another 1 to 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3529660130/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3529660130_8e0975a2f8.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add a second layer of bread.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3528848331/" title="Assembling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/3528848331_671f247db1.jpg" width="450" alt="Assembling" /></a></p>
<p>Add the second half of the eggplant, and all of the remaining sauce.  Make sure that the bread is completely covered by sauce.  Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of great comment and emails about the last dish I posted, along with pleas for post more &#8220;simple and easy meals.&#8221;  So here&#8217;s one more.  I wasn&#8217;t going to post this here, because it&#8217;s SO easy and SO straightforward, I thought it wasn&#8217;t necessarily blog-worthy.  But my husband loves this dish and convinced me to go ahead and do a full post.</p>
<p>We make this meal pretty regularly now, because not only is it a no-brainer, but it also contains only ingredients we tend to have on hand at all times.  So it&#8217;s the perfect &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to make for dinner&#8221; dinner.</p>
<p>This is just your basic fried rice, but it has a secret ingredient (which is totally optional if you can&#8217;t find it and don&#8217;t want to grab it online).  Japanese Seven Spice!  Also called Shichimi Togarashi.  Have you ever had this stuff?  It&#8217;s totally awesome. </p>
<p>With a name like &#8220;seven spice&#8221; I&#8217;m sure you can guess that it&#8217;s made up of seven spices.  They are:  orange peel, black, white, and toasted sesame seeds, cayenne pepper, ginger, poppy seeds, Szechuan pepper, and nori.  While the sesame seeds, nori, ginger and chilies are all very delicious, it&#8217;s the orange peel that really makes this spice mix for me.  It gives it such a bright profile.  I love this stuff on everything now, especially rice and noodle dishes.</p>
<p>I also use Wildwood baked tofu in this dish, because (again) this dish is built for speed and ease.  You can find it at Whole Foods, or get the seemingly-identical Trader Joe&#8217;s version.  You can also use your own baked tofu, too.  I recommend the Wildwood/TJs stuff; it&#8217;s really tasty, nice and firm, and it fries up all pretty-like.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Fried Rice with Japanese Seven Spice</strong><br />
<em>Serves Two</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Brown Rice, dry<br />
2 Cups Water</p>
<p>1-2 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
1 Package Wildwood Baked Tofu, sliced into rectangles (or whatever your favorite tofu is)<br />
1 Stalk Broccoli, chopped into florets<br />
2-3 Carrots, peeled and chopped into chunks<br />
2 Tbs Earth Balance<br />
2 Tbs Tamari or Soy Sauce<br />
1 Tbs Rice Vinegar<br />
Japanese Seven Spice, to taste<br />
2-3 Tbs Toasted Almonds</p>
<p>Start the rice in your rice cooker.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a wok (or skillet, cast-iron preferred) over medium-high heat with a teaspoon or two of oil.  Add the tofu and pan-fry until golden on all sides.  Remove to a bowl.  </p>
<p>Add carrots, with more oil if needed, to the hot wok and cook until tender and browned in places, 5-8 minutes depending on size of chunks.  Remove to the same bowl the tofu is in.</p>
<p>Add broccoli to the wok, again adding a little more oil if needed.  Cook until bright green and tender crisp, 3-4 minutes.  Add the tofu and carrots back to the wok.  Cover wok and turn off or to low heat until the rice is done cooking.</p>
<p>When the rice is done, add it to the wok with the vegetables and tofu.  Add 2 tbs of Earth Balance margarine, 2 Tbs of tamari (or soy sauce) and 1 Tbs of rice vinegar.  Mix well and taste for seasoning.</p>
<p>Plate and top with a generous amount of seven spice and toasted almonds.  Serve.  I think this would reheat well if you wanted to bring leftovers to work.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Online Sources for Seven Spice:<br />
<a href="http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/japanese-seven-spice">The Spice House</a><br />

<p>I have both these brands.  The Spice House one is a coarser mix, a little heavier on the nori, and therefore not bright red like the S&#038;B.  I was worried that the S&#038;B would be much spicier, but it&#8217;s not. They&#8217;re definitely different styles of the same mix, but they&#8217;re both GREAT.  The S&#038;B is what is pictured on this dish.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3393934026/" title="Broccolini, Cherry Tomato, and Butterbean Udon by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3393934026_03de224cec.jpg" width="450" alt="Broccolini, Cherry Tomato, and Butterbean Udon" /></a></p>
<p>I asked my <a href="http://twitter.com/littleturkey">twitter</a> friends if they&#8217;d like to see recipes made for one, and the response was overwhelming; absolutely.  A lot of you seem to make lunch for yourself, or have several weeknights where you&#8217;re cooking solo and want to throw something fresh together without a lot of hassel.  </p>
<p>When I know I&#8217;m going to be eating alone, I rarely do the logical thing and make a big batch of something so I can have leftovers.  I&#8217;m <em>terrible</em> with leftovers.  I&#8217;m too fickle when it comes to food, so leftovers turn to science projects in the fridge.  Therefore I tend to make a lot of one-off meals based on whatever odds and ends of produce I have left.  </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s one of them.  I had one serving broccolini, and half a pint of cherry tomatoes.  Not enough of either to feed both me and my husband, so I made one little but delicious meal out of it.  If you&#8217;re not cooking for one, this dish is easy to scale up, so don&#8217;t worry.  But my friends who dine independently?  This one is especially for you!</p>
<p>Annnd, how about a video?  Here&#8217;s the whole meal, start to finish, in two minutes.  A little overview, if you will.  There&#8217;s nothing difficult about this recipe, so this is more for fun than anything.  You can watch the whole video in HD, full-screen, even!</p>

<p><strong>Broccolini, Cherry Tomato and Butter Bean Udon</strong><br />
<em>Serves One</em></p>
<p>1 to 1 1/2 Bundles Udon Noodles<br />
Oil, about 2-3 Tbs<br />
3-6 Stalks of Broccolini, depending on size<br />
1/2 tsp Red Pepepr Flakes<br />
Black Pepper<br />
Salt<br />
10 Cherry Tomatoes, quartered<br />
1/2 Cup Butter Beans/Lima Beans, drained and rinsed<br />
1-2 tsp Italian Herbs<br />
Balsamic Vinegar, for drizzling</p>
<p>Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add udon noodles and cook for four minutes (or as long as package directions dictate), then drain and rinse well.  Coat lightly with oil to prevent noodles from sticking.  I use spray oil for this, I think it&#8217;s the easiest and you use the least amount of oil.  Set noodles aside.</p>
<p>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium high with a little oil.  Add broccolini and coat with oil.  Season with 1 big pinch of salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Once the broccolini starts to turn bright green and get a little color (just a minute or two), push them to the edge of the pan.  </p>
<p>Turn heat up a little and add quartered cherry tomatoes. Stir to coat in any oil/spices leftover from the broccolini, then let cook, untouched, to get a little color and soften up, 1-2 minutes.  Once tomatoes are softened, add 1/2 cup of butter beans.  Stir everything together and remove to a bowl.</p>
<p>In the still-hot pan, add a 1-2 Tbs more oil.  Add cooked udon noodles to the hot pan, seasoning with a pinch of salt and italian herbs. Toss to coat the pasta.  Once the pasta is coated and is heated through, add back the broccolini, beans, and tomatoes.  Taste and season with more salt or pepper if needed.</p>
<p>Plate, and drizzle with balsamic vinegar if desired.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3294984965/" title="Vegetable Tempura by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3540/3294984965_1090857274.jpg" width="450" alt="Vegetable Tempura" /></a></p>
<p>I really love vegetable tempura, but it often the batter contains eggs, so I have to skip it when I&#8217;m eating at a japanese restaurant.  But it&#8217;s really easy to make eggless tempura at home.  You can absolutely pick up a box mix of &#8220;tempura powder&#8221; at a local asian market and skip the egg the directions call for &#8212; even the box says it&#8217;s optional.  Or, you can use this recipe and make your own batter from scratch.</p>
<p>When you see &#8220;serve immediately&#8221; at the bottom of this recipe, I&#8217;m not kidding.  You want to have absolutely everything set and everyone ready to eat when the veggies come out of the oil.  As the veggies cool, the once crispy breading will begins to soften, leaving you with soggy tempura. No fun.  So make sure you have your place settings, your dipping sauce, and your friends or family ready to go once the veggies hit the oil.</p>
<p>The oil temperature needs to be 180º C or 350º F.  If you add a lot of veggies to the oil at once, not only will they stick together (not so bad), but the oil temperature will drop like a rock (very bad).  Tempura fried at too low a temperature will never become crispy.  It&#8217;ll cook, but it&#8217;ll be a soft, heavy coating instead of a light, crispy one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3294984921/" title="Vegetable Tempura by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3470/3294984921_5cd81323ce_m.jpg" width="179" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Vegetable Tempura" /></a>How can you tell if your oil is hot enough?  When you drop a batter coated veggie in, little bits of batter will explode off the veggie outward like tempura fireworks.  These bits, called tenkasu, are a good indication that your batter is hot enough.  The veggies should cook for 40 seconds to 1 minute and feel crispy when you knock them around.  You don&#8217;t need them to be golden brown, so don&#8217;t wait for that.</p>
<p>Most vegetables will cook to the perfect tenderness in that time, including harder ones like carrots if you keep their width to 1/4&#8243; thick.  For harder vegetables like squash or sweet potatoes, you may want to briefly blanch them to get them going before frying.  But broccoli, mushrooms, and green beans or snap peas don&#8217;t require any pre-cooking at all.</p>
<p>I recommend a traditional tentsuyu dipping sauce for these.  My recipe is a little different than the ones you find online, but it&#8217;s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetable Tempura </strong><br />
<em>Serves 2-4</em></p>
<p>1 Liter Vegetable Oil, for frying<br />
1 Stalk Broccoli, florets only<br />
2 Carrots, sliced on the bias, 1/4&#8243; thick<br />
1 Cup Mushrooms, your favorite<br />
1 Cup Sugar Snap Peas or Green Beans<br />
(Feel free to use any vegetables you like!)</p>
<p><em>Tempura Batter</em><br />
1 Cup Cold Water (very cold!)<br />
1 Cup Flour<br />
2 Pinches Salt<br />
1/4 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 Tbs Ener-g Egg Replacer Powder mixed with 3 Tbs Water<br />
1/4 Cup Extra Water, if needed, for thinning</p>
<p><em>Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce</em><br />
1/4 Cup Vegetable Stock, or Dashi if you have it<br />
1 Tbs Sugar<br />
1/4 Cup Low Sodium Tamari<br />
1 Tbs Rice Vinegar<br />
1/4 Cup Water</p>
<p>Heat all the sauce ingredients in a small pan until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Chop your vegetables, making sure harder vegetables like carrots are no more than 1/4&#8243; thick if frying raw. Blanch vegetables like squash or sweet potatoes, if using.</p>

<p>Heat your oil to 350º F.  A little bit of batter dropped into the oil should float to the surface immediately, and little bits of batter should explode off the veggies when frying.  </p>
<p>Dip your vegetables in the batter.</p>

<p>Drop an assortment of battered vegetables into the oil, being careful not to overcrowd.  You may need to turn up the temperature of the oil, because the vegetables will cool it.  </p>
<p>Fry for 40 seconds to 1 minute until very crispy and light.  Drain on a paper towel for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Serve immediately with dipping sauce and/or salt and pepper.</p>
