<p>I think we&#8217;re being taken over by fried green tomatoes.  I&#8217;ve never had fried green tomatoes before.  I went to the farmers market, and there was a lovely and beautiful looking pile of green tomatoes.  I had to buy them.  HAD TO.</p>
<p>So I get home and I ask my twitter pals if they&#8217;re interested in a FGT post.  A lot of people responded they were, and then I was led to <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2009/08/oven-fried-green-tomatoes.html">Susan&#8217;s latest post of <i>baked</i> green tomatoes</a>.    Then I found out my landlord made some for dinner that same night.  At least two more people said they&#8217;ve been thinking of making them.  Clearly this is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>A tasty conspiracy.  </p>
<p>As I said earlier, I&#8217;ve never had fried green tomatoes.  I love tomatoes, but only when cooked.  The idea of eating under ripe tomatoes on purpose freaked me out a little.  But then I thought, hey, these are fried?  What could possibly taste bad after frying?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3823327213/" title="Green Tomatoes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2666/3823327213_85fa2a821f_o.jpg" width="450" alt="Green Tomatoes" /></a></p>
<p>When shopping for green tomatoes, it&#8217;s important to pick up under ripe, very firm, completely green tomatoes.  They should be about the same size as a regular tomato.  Smaller green tomatoes will taste bitter, and there are varieties of tomatoes (particularly heirloom varieties) that can be green and ripe at the same time, so make sure you don&#8217;t rely on color alone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little disconcerting when you cut into a tomato and it sounds like a crisp apple, but that&#8217;s exactly what you want for this recipe.</p>
<p>After frying, they&#8217;re surprisingly tasty.  They are sweet and tangy, still firm, and juicy&#8211;almost citrusy.  The salty breading sets them off really nicely, and I topped them with a homemade balsamic glaze.  They&#8217;re perfect for a light summer lunch or dinner when paired with some delicate baby greens, but they&#8217;re easy enough to make as a side dish.  </p>
<p><strong>Fried Green Tomatoes</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 20 slices</em></p>
<p>4 Large, Under Ripe Green Tomatoes<br />
Oil, for frying (peanut or canola)<br />
Baby Greens, for serving<br />
Cherry Tomatoes, for decoration<br />
Balsamic Reduction (<a href="../../../2007/12/baked-sundried-tomato-risotto-with-grilled-veggies-and-balsamic-reduction/index.html">see recipe</a>)</p>
<p><i>Breading Dry Mix</i><br />
2 Cups Corn Flour/Meal<br />
1/2 Cup All-Purpose Flour<br />
1 Tbs plus 1 tsp Salt<br />
1 Tbs Dried Italian Seasoning<br />
1 tsp Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</p>
<p><i>Breading Wet Mix</i><br />
1 Tbs Ener-G Egg Replacer Powder<br />
3 Tbs Boiling Water<br />
1/2 Cup Non-Dairy Milk</p>
<p>Core the green tomatoes and slice in to 1/2&#8243; slices.  If desired, season each side lightly with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3823327347/" title="Green Tomatoes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2532/3823327347_1536459d46.jpg" width="450" alt="Green Tomatoes" /></a></p>
<p>Lay tomato slices on paper towels and pat dry.  </p>
<p>Mix together the dry seasoning mix and set aside.  </p>
<p>Combine the boiling water and egg replacer powder and whisk until thick and foamy.  Add to a separate large bowl.  Whisk in the non-dairy milk until thick and frothy.  Set aside.  You should now have two bowls, one with the dry breading mix and one with the wet.</p>
<p>Heat a large cast-iron skillet until hot but not smoking with 1/4 to 1/2&#8243; of oil in the bottom.</p>
<p>Dredge the tomato slices, four at a time, in the wet batter mix.  Then place them into the bowl with the dry batter mix, pressing to make sure it sticks.  Fry four at a time for 3 minutes a side, or until golden.  Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p>Stack the fried green tomatoes on baby greens with sliced cherry tomatoes.  Drizzle with balsamic reduction.  Serve warm, while breading is still crispy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191058991/" title="Eggplant and Pinenut Rolled Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/3191058991_915da762dc.jpg" width="450" alt="Eggplant and Pinenut Rolled Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>I tend to get my fresh vegetables on Tuesday, so by the time Sunday rolls around, I&#8217;m down a lot of produce. I wanted to make something yummy for dinner, but the only fresh veggie I had was an eggplant.  My husband has undertaken a massive pantry operation (we have synched eLists and everything now), so I knew I had lasagna noodles, canned tomatoes, and pine nuts in with our non-perishables.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to play around with the idea of rolled lasagna for a while.  It&#8217;s fun, easy, and not as messy to serve.  I&#8217;ve found that vegan lasagna falls apart even more readily than its dairy counterpart since it doesn&#8217;t have solidifying cheese to keep it together.  Rolled lasagna holds its shape marvelously <i>and</i> it&#8217;s attractive.  It&#8217;s also a great way to make smaller portions of lasagna, if you don&#8217;t want a huge casserole dish full of it.</p>
<p>I baked mine in gratin dishes (you know me and individually portioned food).  You can just as easily bake this in one large dish; there shouldn&#8217;t be a difference.  You can also fill them with whatever you like.  I think sundried tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, roasted peppers&#8230; any of those would be a fabulous addition.  I&#8217;ll add some possible variations to the recipe below.</p>
<p><strong>Eggplant and Pine Nut Rolled Lasagna</strong><br />
<em>Serves 4 (easily adapted)</em></p>
<p>8 Lasagna Noodles<br />
1 Eggplant<br />
Olive Oil<br />
Salt<br />
Black Pepper<br />
2+ Cups Marinara Sauce (your favorite)<br />
2 Slices Bread, toasted (or prepared breadcrumbs)</p>
<p><em>Pine Nut Spread</em><br />
1 Cup Pine Nuts<br />
1 Tbs Water<br />
1/2 tsp White Wine Vinegar, or lemon juice<br />
1 tsp Dried Italian Herbs<br />
1/4 &#8211; 1/2 tsp Salt</p>
<p><em>Variation Ideas:</em><br />
Add 1/3 Cup of Sun Dried tomatoes to pine nut spread<br />
Add 1 Cup of sauteed spinach when filling<br />
Add fresh baby spinach leaves when filling<br />
Add 1 Cup of sauteed mushrooms when filling<br />
Add strips of sauteed summer squash when filling</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191058373/" title="Lasagna Noodles by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3191058373_a5d56c6710_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Lasagna Noodles" /></a>Boil noodles in salted water until al dente.  Drain and lay out the noodles on a cookie sheet, lightly spraying with oil so that they do not stick.  Set aside.</p>
<p>Peel eggplant.  I find the easiest way to do this is to cut off both ends and use the edge provided to get your vegetable peeler started.  I&#8217;ve found it difficult to get the peeler to cut the skin otherwise.</p>
<p>Place the eggplant upright on the cutting board.  Slice the eggplant in long, thin vertical slices.  Then slice each of these in half again, also vertically.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191058157/" title="Sliced Eggplant by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3191058157_b688990dea.jpg" width="450" alt="Sliced Eggplant" /></a></p>
<p>In a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet, begin browning the eggplant strips in olive oil, 2-3 Tbs a batch (or more).  When strips are very tender and nicely browned on both sides, set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191058267/" title="Cooked Eggplant by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/3191058267_313c41fc9b.jpg" width="450" alt="Cooked Eggplant" /></a></p>
<p>In the hot skillet you cooked the eggplant in, add the pine nuts.  Toast the pine nuts over medium-low heat until golden brown, being careful not to burn.  Add the pine nuts to the work bowl of a food processor.  Grind the nuts as well as you can, then add the remaining ingredients for the pine nut spread.  Process until well combined.</p>
<p>Toast the bread and process into breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400º F.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly</strong></p>
<p>Spread a little pine nut spread ontp each noodle.  You don&#8217;t need a lot, it&#8217;s very rich!  Add eggplant strips, as well as any other filling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191905804/" title="Filling Rolled Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3433/3191905804_8fa416a953.jpg" width="450" alt="Filling Rolled Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>Roll up each noodle and place in your baking dish(es) seam-side down.  Cover generously with sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3191905876/" title="Eggplant and Pinenut Rolled Lasagna by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3412/3191905876_0c27f6b74e.jpg" width="450" alt="Eggplant and Pinenut Rolled Lasagna" /></a></p>
<p>Top with breadcrumbs and bake for 20-25 minutes.  Since everything is already cooked, they just need to heat up and slightly brown.  If you&#8217;re baking them in individual gratin dishes as shown here, place all the dishes on a baking sheet for easier removal from the oven.  Serve immediately!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3133342807/" title="Gingerbread Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/3133342807_a5a85fd6e3_b.jpg" width="450" alt="Gingerbread Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and so my husband and I are about to hop in the car to visit his side of the family.  I&#8217;m brining along these cute little gingerbread cakes to share for dessert.</p>
<p>These cakes are spicy and dense (in a good way) with just a tad of lemon cream cheese frosting to complement them.  They have the consistency of a cake-y brownie but the flavor of gingerbread cookies.  The petite cakes are about the size of cupcakes, but with a touch more style.</p>
<p>Frosting the sides of the cakes turned out to be a disaster.  Feel free to try it, but all the cake crumbs made for a messy finish, even with a crum layer of icing to minimize them.  I prefer the look of these bare-sided cakes, which has the extra benefit of better proportion of frosting to cake.  If you like frosting but are easily overwhelmed by it, leaving the sides unfinished might be a good solution for you, too.</p>
<p>I baked these as 8&#215;8 sheet cakes and then used a biscuit cutter to punch out small rounds after the cake had baked and cooled.  You can also just make cupcakes if you don&#8217;t want to deal with the assembly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134163592/" title="Gingerbread Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/3134163592_0e9a17f204.jpg" width="450" alt="Gingerbread Cakes" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Gingerbread Cakes</strong><br />
<em>Makes 9 small layer cakes</em></p>
<p>2 Cups Flour<br />
2 tsp Ginger<br />
2 tsp Cinnamon<br />
1/2 tsp Salt<br />
1/2 tsp Baking Soda<br />
1 Cup Molasses (unsulphured, like Grandma&#8217;s brand)<br />
2/3 Cup Hot Water<br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/2 Cup Sugar<br />
1 Ener-g Egg, optional</p>
<p><em>Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting</em><br />
8 oz Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese<br />
1/4 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1 lb Confectioner&#8217;s Sugar<br />
2 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
Zest from 1 Lemon</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350º F.</p>
<p>Mix the flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl until well combined.</p>
<p>Prepare two 8&#215;8 baking pans as follows: grease the pans with margarine.  Lay a square of parchment paper down in the inside of the pans, cut to fit the bottoms.  Grease the paper as well.  Use some of the try mixture you just made to flour the pans, shaking/tapping out any extra.</p>
<p>Whisk molasses and hot water together. </p>
<p>Cream the margarine and sugar.  Whip the mixture with the optional Ener-g egg until light and fluffy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3133332639/" title="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/3133332639_08a2a9abeb.jpg" width="450" alt="Creaming Earth Balance and Sugar" /></a></p>
<p>Add part of the molasses mixture and part of the margarine and sugar mixture to the dry ingredients.  Begin to combine.  As the ingredients come together, add more of the margarine mixture and more of the molasses mixture until everything has been incorporated.  Whisk to remove lumps, but to not over-mix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134154762/" title="Gingerbread Cake Batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3134154762_e8d1db3c26.jpg" width="450" alt="Gingerbread Cake Batter" /></a></p>
<p>Pour the batter evenly into the two prepared pans.  Bake at 350º F for 30-40 minutes until a cake tester comes out clean, or the top of the cake, when touched, springs back.  Let cakes cool completely, then remove from the pan.  You may need to use a knife to loosen the edges, but the parchment paper should keep the bottoms from sticking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134155544/" title="Gingerbread Cake Batter by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3196/3134155544_9728b6a6fb.jpg" width="450" alt="Gingerbread Cake Batter" /></a></p>
<p>Once the cakes have cooled and have been removed from the pans, use a small biscuit cutter to cut 9 rounds from each cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3133334725/" title="Gingerbread Cake Rounds by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/3133334725_d3a67105f6.jpg" width="450" alt="Gingerbread Cake Rounds" /></a></p>
<p>Prepare frosting by beating all of the frosting ingredients in a stand mixee until well combined and fluffy.</p>
<p>Place a small amount of frosting on 9 rounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134158300/" title="Filling the cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/3134158300_cf46b2cef1.jpg" width="450" alt="Filling the cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Stack the rounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134159266/" title="Filled Cakes by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/3134159266_9266afefff.jpg" width="450" alt="Filled Cakes" /></a></p>
<p>Place the rest of the frosting in a piping bag and frost the top of each cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3134160374/" title="Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/3134160374_88258110e1.jpg" width="450" alt="Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting" /></a></p>
<p>I garnished them with green and red nonpareils, but maraschino cherries would be awesome! Keep in an airtight container until ready to serve.  </p>
<p>I hope you all have a great holiday season!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s well over 90º outside.  I live at the top of a three family home, where the flat roof and lack of attic does a bang up job of trapping all the building&#8217;s heat in my living space.  We have a few feeble fans running throughout the apartment, but there&#8217;s not much we can do during the hottest part of the day, especially during a heat wave.</p>
<p>The desire to cook is slowing ebbing out of me, so I wanted to take this opportunity to announce that <a href="http://vegnews.com">VegNews Magazine</a> has named me one of the top veg blogs of 2008!</p>
<p>You can find me and the 20 other bloggers who won in their July/August issue.

<p>I thought I&#8217;d direct you to some no-cook or low-cook recipes in case you&#8217;re also caught in the heatwave. Here are some from the archives:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2462707846/" title="Flaky Pizza Purses by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2382/2462707846_ce7bdf36db.jpg" alt="Flaky Pizza Purses" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>A <a href="../../../2007/10/mac-and-cheese-cheeze-yeast/index.html">while back</a> I mentioned that I had found a vegan cheese that was pretty damn good.  I&#8217;ve spent some time playing around with it, and I finally have a post ready for you all.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t often use vegan cheese.  Vegan cheese usually sucks, and I&#8217;ve found that the longer I&#8217;m vegan (just over four years now), the less I want to eat things similar to cheese (or any other non-vegan product).  Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not good every once in a while.  But I don&#8217;t feel like I <em>need</em> it anymore.  I don&#8217;t require it to be satisfied, which is a great thing.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m always interested in new vegan cheeses.  When I first went vegan I bought all the different brands I could find and taste-tested them.  I was very disappointed.  I coudn&#8217;t believe that no one could come up with a better vegan cheese.  Sure, it&#8217;s definitely possible to develop a taste for some of the products out there, but they don&#8217;t win you over on the first bite.  And they&#8217;d never, ever fool someone.</p>
<p>So when Scott from Black Duck Imports contacted me to ask if I&#8217;d like to try some <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/">Sheese vegan cheese</a>, I was definitely curious.  Surely someone, somewhere, had made some improvements on the vegan cheese front.  I told him I&#8217;d be happy to try it, but I wasn&#8217;t going to mention a peep about it on the blog unless I really liked it.</p>
<p>And I really like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1605405229/" title="Medium Cheddar Sheese by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/1605405229_4ef252b0ac.jpg" alt="Medium Cheddar Sheese" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>The taste, especially in their various cheddars, is great.  The texture is perfect for grating, shaving, or slicing.  It doesn&#8217;t feel oily or wet like some other cheeses out there.  It&#8217;s very flavorful, so you don&#8217;t need a lot to flavor a dish.</p>
<p>The downsides?  It doesn&#8217;t really melt, so it&#8217;s better mixed into something than on top of  something.  It comes in a wide variety of flavors, but the cheddars taste the best to me; the mozzarella is fine but it doesn&#8217;t taste like mozzarella, and I downright disliked the gouda.  My favorite is the smoked cheddar.  I often use a vegetable peeler to shave some off onto pasta.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2385633228/" title="Rigatoni with Rosemary, Black Pepper, and Smoked Cheddar Sheese by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2385633228_2743111b15.jpg" alt="Rigatoni with Rosemary, Black Pepper, and Smoked Cheddar Sheese" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>So now to the recipe.  When I think I cheese I usually think pizza (a side effect of growing up in Chicago, the land of perfect pizza pie), but since sheese wouldn&#8217;t really melt all that well, I had to come up with an alternate plan.  Then it hit me: if you use phyllo, you can easily put the cheese <em>inside</em> the pizza.  Like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2462704542/" title="Flaky Pizza Purse by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2195/2462704542_b09861910b.jpg" alt="Flaky Pizza Purse" height="450" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>This dish makes a perfect starter, and besides the little bit of stress phyllo causes, it&#8217;s really easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2462671066/" title="Plyllo Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2462671066_10cd058f4c_m.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Plyllo Dough" height="240" width="240" /></a><em>Special notes for phyllo dough:</em> Located in the freezer section of your grocery store.  Keep frozen, placing unopened package in the refrigerator the night before to defrost.  Do not defrost at room temperature.  Once defrosted, move dough from refrigerator to counter two hours before use.  Keep any opened dough covered with a damp kitchen towel and/or plastic wrap to prevent drying.  Re-wrap unused portion immediately and refrigerate for 1 week, or refreeze.</p>
<p><strong>Flaky Pizza Purses</strong><br />
<em>Makes 6 Starters </em></p>
<p>1 Recipe 6 Minute Tomato Sauce (below)<br />
5 Sheets Phyllo Dough<br />
1/4 to 1/2 Wheel of Sheese, any flavor, shredded<br />
Fresh Basil Leaves<br />
5 Tbs Melted Earth Balance Margarine</p>
<p><em>Six Minute Tomato Sauce</em><br />
1 Tbs Olive Oil<br />
1 Pint Sweet Grape Tomatoes<br />
1/4 tsp Salt (more to taste, if desired)<br />
1/2 tsp Dried Italian Herbs</p>
<p>Begin by making the tomato sauce.  Heat oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan and add tomatoes.  Toss in oil and cook until tomatoes begin to soften and burst.  Add salt and herbs.  You can help the tomatoes along by popping them with the tip of a knife as they expand.  Gently mash the tomatoes, but not enough to loose their basic shape.  Total cooking time approximately six minutes until the sauce is ready to go.  Set aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461836621/" title="Tomato Sauce by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2368/2461836621_78167434d1.jpg" alt="Tomato Sauce" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400º F.</p>
<p>Get your work station ready with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2462675516/">everything you&#8217;ll need</a> (photo) to make the purses.  You&#8217;ll need a large area to spread the dough out on, tomato sauce, shredded sheese, basil, melted earth balance, a brush, and a damp kitchen towel/plastic wrap.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to open the dough, unroll it, remove 5 sheets, cover the 5 sheets, re-roll and re-package the remaining dough&#8230;.all as fast as you possibly can.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461845205/" title="IMG_4123 by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3023/2461845205_7853166376.jpg" alt="IMG_4123" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Once the leftover dough as been put away, you&#8217;ll begin brushing and stacking each of the five sheets.  Always re-cover the sheets you&#8217;re not currently working with, or else they&#8217;ll dry out.</p>
<p>Remove one sheet from the stack of five and lay it out in front of you.  Brush with melted Earth Balance, starting at the edges and working in to the center (the edges will dry out the fastest, this prevents that).  If you get some rips or tears, don&#8217;t worry&#8211;it won&#8217;t be noticeable by the time you&#8217;re done.  Just repair them as best you can and move on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461848705/" title="Brushing the Phyllo Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/2461848705_bc4d3b388c.jpg" alt="Brushing the Phyllo Dough" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Once covered in Earth Balance, place the second sheet on top.  Brush.  Repeat this process until all 5 phyllo sheets have been stacked and brushed.  Using a pizza cutter, cut dough into six squares (one cut lengthwise, two cuts widthwise).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461852375/" title="Cutting the Phyllo Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2193/2461852375_55c6bedd1c.jpg" alt="Cutting the Phyllo Dough" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Now you can relax.  The dough won&#8217;t dry out so quick now that it&#8217;s coated in Earth Balance.  Place 1/6 of the sauce in the middle of each square.  The add cheese and a few basil leaves.  I left mine whole because I&#8217;m lazy, but you can chop yours up if you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461859367/" title="Filling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2213/2461859367_a35e076062.jpg" alt="Filling" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Gather the edges of the squares into the center, twisting to seal and form a purse.  Place the completed purses on a baking sheet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2462695436/" title="Forming the purses by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/2462695436_255b49c39a.jpg" alt="Forming the purses" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Give the purses one final brush of Earth Balance before going in the oven.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2461867837/" title="Brushing the purses by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/2461867837_a4800f1b34.jpg" alt="Brushing the purses" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Bake for 10-15 minutes (I did 15) until the purses turn golden brown along the edges and the body feels cooked and flaky.  Top with fresh basil leaves and serve warm.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://blackduckimports.com/consumers.cfm">here</a> for more information on where to purchase Sheese.  I usually purchase it online through <a href="http://store.nexternal.com/shared/StoreFront/default.asp?CS=vegane&StoreType=BtoC&Count1=99666774&Count2=16807198&Keyword=sheese&Target=products.asp&Submit1.x=0&Submit1.y=0">Vegan Essentials</a>.  I hope you like it as much as I do!  And hey, if you&#8217;re looking for a mozzarella that really melts, check out the newest vegan cheese on the block, <a href="http://www.teesecheese.com/">Teese</a>.  I had it on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/2456354924/">a pizza in Seattle</a> and it was great!</p>

<p>There are innumerable recipes for vegan mac and cheese on the internet.  I&#8217;ve tried a lot of them.  Some of them simply call for &#8220;slices of soy cheese&#8221; and some vegetable stock to be mixed over pasta.  The majority, however, require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast">nutritional yeast</a>, and they usually also require making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">roux</a>.  The recipe below is from my upcoming cookbook, and it&#8217;s one of my favorites.   However, if you&#8217;ll indulge me for a moment, there are some things about vegan mac and cheeze I want to talk about.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m the first to admit &#8220;Mac and Yeast&#8221; doesn&#8217;t <i>quite</i> have the same ring to it.  That&#8217;s why I tend to call it &#8220;Mac and Cheeze&#8221;.  But I&#8217;m also the first to admit that these recipes, even the best of them, don&#8217;t really taste all that much like mac and cheese.  Some get much closer than others, and a lot are downright tasty.  But it&#8217;s not cheese.  Your omnivore or veggie friend/spouse/child may love it as much as or even more than the real stuff (if you&#8217;re lucky), but they probably love it on its own merits, not because they really can&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>But you know what?  It doesn&#8217;t have to taste exactly the same for me to love it.</p>
<p>A lot of people, myself included, are really interested in making vegan food that&#8217;s indistinguishable from the &#8220;real&#8221; thing.  It&#8217;s a fun challenge, and oftentimes, a challenge where you can really and truly be successful.  But there are many instances where you don&#8217;t create something identical, but what you <i>do</i> create is actually good.  Different, but yummy. While vegan mac and cheese doesn&#8217;t taste exactly like non-vegan mac and cheese, it <i>satisfies the same craving</i>.  It&#8217;s rich and creamy and salty and vaguely cheese-like.  It&#8217;s a yummy, thick creamy sauce to top noodles with.  </p>
<p>I think that sometimes it&#8217;s enough to satisfy your cravings with something similar, if you can&#8217;t find something identical.  After three years of being vegan, I don&#8217;t even crave mac and cheese anymore; I crave mac and yeast.</p>
<p>I think expectation is important with food.  If it looks like a grape, you expect it to taste like a grape.  If I hand you a glass of sparkling wine and tell you it&#8217;s gingerale, you might be put off when you take a sip.  You might even like wine, but you expected it to be, well, not wine.  If I say, &#8220;here, try this mac and cheese&#8221; and give you mac and yeast, you might be disappointed when you tasted it.  If you&#8217;ve never tried a mac and yeast recipe before, and you want to try this one, keep in mind that it doesn&#8217;t taste like cheese.  </p>
<p>It just tastes like yummy.  Well, it does to me and the vegans that tested the recipe for me!</p>
<p><strong>Mac and Cheeze</strong><br />
<em>Serves 2-3</em></p>
<p>1/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/4 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
2 1/2 Tbs Low Sodium Tamari or Soy Sauce<br />
1 Tbs Lemon Juice, fresh<br />
1 Tbs Sweet/White/Mellow Miso<br />
1 Tbs Tahini<br />
1 Tbs Tomato Paste (not sauce!)<br />
1 1/4 Cup Soy Milk<br />
1/3 Cup <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast">Nutritional Yeast</a><br />
1 Pinch Salt<br />
Black Pepper, to taste</p>
<p>Begin by heating a sauce pan and adding the earth balance.  Once melted, add flour and whisk vigorously until a smooth paste forms, called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">roux</a>.  Be careful not to add flour to a pan that is very hot, or your roux will be lumpy and you&#8217;ll need to start over.  If you mix in the flour as soon as the margarine is melted and you should avoid any problems.</p>
<p>To this paste, add tamari, lemon, miso, tahini, and tomato paste and whisk until well incorporated.  The mixture should still be paste-like.  Then slowly pour in the soymilk, whisking constantly, until it is completely incorporated.  Add the yeast and mix well.  Cook the mixture until it thickens, whisking often.  This should take approximately 5 minutes, but it&#8217;s flexible.  Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p><em>I like this the most baked.  Cook 3 cups of dry, small pasta (like elbows or shells or rotini) and toss with the finished cheezy sauce.  Add steamed broccoli (pictured) for a real treat.  Top with fresh breadcrumbs and bake at 400Âº for 25 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spilled so much ink so far (well, pixels) telling you that vegan cheese doesn&#8217;t taste like cheese, so I figured I&#8217;d close the entry with this:  vegan cheese that, to me, tastes like mother forkin&#8217; cheese!  It deserves an entire entry devoted to it, so I&#8217;ll just leave you with this until part two of my vegan cheese post:</p>

<p>Summer means lots and lots of berries.  Stuffed banana berry french toast is a good way to use them!  I&#8217;ve been thinking about stuffed french toast for a while now, and this is really a very simple, but supremely satisfying version.  Most stuffed french toasts call for for a cream cheese filling, but why bother with that when you have perfectly ripe bananas and berries begging to be used?  Topped with fresh strawberry orange sauce, maple syrup, and powdered sugar, and I certainly can&#8217;t refuse this breakfast.</p>
<p>This french toast recipe is going into the book/zine, so you&#8217;ll have to wait a bit for the recipe, but I think it&#8217;ll be worth it!</p>

<p>My mom and my sister got me a Lodge griddle/grill and a 10&#8243; skillet for my birthday.  I&#8217;m so excited to have some cast iron cookware at my disposal now, especially a griddle and grill!  I spent most of yesterday seasoning it (they came &#8220;foundry seasoned&#8221; but I&#8217;ve read they can use a bit more before the first use) so I could make my first dish, grilled tofu.</p>
<p>A simple dish of tofu, greens and rice really gets fancied up with a few grill marks, doesn&#8217;t it?  It was easy to do and faster than baking.  I think I&#8217;m going to have to apologize in advance for the proliferation of grilled things that I&#8217;m sure are about to appear on this blog</p>
<p>The recipe for the tofu is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Vengeance-Delicious-Animal-Free-Recipes/dp/1569243581">Vwav</a>, so I don&#8217;t have a recipe to post.  If you don&#8217;t have the book (buy it already!) you can use any tofu marinade you like or can find on the web &#8211; this one has a mirin and soy base.  I do have a few tips though!</p>
<p>I used to be silly and toss my tofu marinade out, wishing I could do something with it.  Here are two ideas that I used in this dish.</p>
<p>1.  Place greens in a heated saute pan and dribble with a little of the marindate &#8211; use this for your flavoring, and you have a dish that goes very well with your tofu!</p>
<p>2.  Remove the greens from the pan and add the rest of the marinade.  It should start simmering quickly because there probably isn&#8217;t that much of it &#8211; don&#8217;t worry about the small amount.  Mix a little bit of cornstarch with some water and pour into the pan, whisking constantly until a glaze forms.  Drizzle this over the tofu and greens.</p>
<p>Since marinades are usually strong, you&#8217;ll only need a little bit for the greens and just a drizzle of sauce.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to let lunch sneak up on me.  All of a sudden it&#8217;s 12:30 and I&#8217;m starving.  This is a super quick lunch or side dish, even though it looks like it has a lot of ingredients.  If you have these spices standing by, it takes all of a minute to measure everything out.  Chopping the carrots doesn&#8217;t take that long either, but you could always just pulse them a few times in your food processor if you want.</p>
<p>If you want, feel free to used steamed cauliflower instead of tofu in this dish.  I think it&#8217;d be great that way!</p>
<p><strong>Indian Spiced Tofu</strong><br />
<em>Serves two, but I almost at the whole thing!</em></p>
<p>1 Block Extra Firm Tofu, pressed*<br />
2 Small Carrots, finely chopped<br />
1/4 Cup Frozen Peas<br />
2 tsp Lemon Juice<br />
2 tsp Earth Balance</p>
<p><em>Spices</em><br />
1/2 tsp Mustard Seeds (brown/black)<br />
1/2 tsp Cumin Seeds<br />
1/4 tsp Turmeric<br />
1/4 tsp Paprika<br />
1/2 tsp Coriander<br />
1/2 tsp Pepper Flakes (scant)<br />
1/2 tsp Salt</p>
<p>Heat vegetable oil (1-2 Tbs worth) in a skillet over medium heat.  When oil is hot, add spices and stir.  When mustard seeds begin to pop, add lemon juice.  Let the juice bubble for a a few seconds, then add carrots and saute until just tender, 2-3 minutes.  Add tofu and stir to coat, breaking up large pieces until you get a consistency you like.  Taste and adjust seasonings (you might want more salt or lemon juice).</p>
<p>When mixture is hot again, add peas and mix gently until thawed.  Add earth balance and stir until melted and evenly distributed.  Serve immediately!</p>
<p>*You can press your tofu like a normal person (i.e. for a while with weights, letting it drain into a sink or a bowl) or you can do what I do when I&#8217;m just going to crumble the tofu anyway:</p>
<p>1.  Drain off excess liquid from tofu.<br />
2.  Place tofu at the short end of a clean terry cloth rag<br />
3.  Roll up the tofu!<br />
4.  Squeeze the dickens out of it, allowing yourself to crush it a little.<br />
5.  Unroll into a bowl or directly into your pan.</p>
<p>Voila!Â  And it already starts the crumbling process, which makes it a great way to press the tofu for this dish.</p>
