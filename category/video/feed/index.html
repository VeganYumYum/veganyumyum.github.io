<p>I adore this recipe. </p>
<p>When I went vegan a little over five years ago, I had a minor panic attack when I realized I&#8217;d never eat another Cinnabon again.  I remember I used to ask my dad to bring them home from the airport for me when I was little, whenever he had a business trip.  The fluffy swirls of dough, the sugary syrup, the cream cheese frosting&#8230; I needed to recreate them perfectly, vegan style.  And let me tell you, these are a dead ringer for our mall and airport favorites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759744/" title="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3611/3511759744_850ede165d_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Cinnamon Buns with Cream Cheese Frosting" /></a>But it comes at a price.  If you&#8217;re looking for a healthy, low-fat, calorie conscious treat, I can&#8217;t help you today.  If you&#8217;re looking for a recipe that is guaranteed to win over any vegan doubter, guaranteed to please any Cinnabon lover, guaranteed to send any child into a permanent sugar high; these buns are for you.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of sugar and Earth Balance margarine in these.  But hey, the recipe makes a ton of rolls, and it takes four hours to make, so they&#8217;re really special occasion buns.  Embrace the cups (and cups) of sugar and fat, and you will definitely be rewarded with the most perfect cinnamon bun you&#8217;ve ever had.  Isn&#8217;t it worth it, at least once?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t yet overcome your apprehension about yeast breads, I encourage you to give these a try.  I&#8217;ve included tons of photos <em>and</em> a video to clarify the process and give you an idea how the dough is supposed to look at every step.  They might seem intimidating, but they&#8217;re easier than you think!  </p>
<p>I think these would be an amazing way to wake up Mom on Sunday, paired with a nice hot cup of coffee.  You can make these ahead of time, refrigerating over night before the second rise and popping them in the oven in the morning, or you can freeze them for later.  More info on that at the end of the recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Cinnamon Buns</strong><br />
<em>Makes 12 Large Buns</em></p>
<p><em>Yeast Mixture</em><br />
4 tsp Active Dry Yeast (a little less than 2 packets)<br />
1 tsp Sugar<br />
1 Cup Water, 110ยบ F</p>
<p><em>Dough</em><br />
1 Cup Soymilk<br />
2/3 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
2 tsp Salt<br />
2 Ener-g Egg Replacer Eggs, prepared, optional<br />
Yeast Mixture, from above<br />
6 Cups All Purpose Flour, more for kneading</p>
<p><em>Dough Filling</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1 1/2 Cups Sugar<br />
3 Tbs Cinnamon</p>
<p><em>Pan Sauce</em><br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine, melted<br />
1/3 Cup Sugar</p>
<p><em>Cream Cheese Frosting </em><br />
1/4 Cup Earth Balance<br />
1/3 Cup Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1 Cup Powdered Sugar</p>
<p>Combine yeast mixture and set aside to proof.</p>
<p>From the dough ingredients, combine the soymilk, sugar, earth balance, salt, and ener-g eggs in a small sauce pan.  Heat until earth balance is melted and all the ingredients are well combined, but do not let the mixture get too hot.  You should be able to put a finger in it without burning yourself.</p>
<p>The yeast should now be nice and foamy (proofed).  Combine it with the warmed liquid you just made; make sure it&#8217;s not too hot, or you will kill your yeast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759002/" title="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3511759002_8da80553b5.jpg" width="450" alt="Proofed Yeast and Liquid Ingredients" /></a></p>
<p>Place 4 cups of all purpose flour in a large bowl.  Add the warmed wet ingredients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947095/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3510947095_18541808d4.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Beat the batter well with a wooden spoon.  The dough will be very wet and liquid, much more like a batter than a dough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947133/" title="Mixing the Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3510947133_6f1c0e20c9.jpg" width="450" alt="Mixing the Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Add 2 more cups of flour and mix in partially.  It&#8217;ll look like a wreck.  That&#8217;s fine!  Turn out the dough onto a large table/kneading surface, scraping out everything in the bowl.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3511759156/" title="Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3511759156_55f79e8e1b.jpg" width="450" alt="Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Begin kneading, gently at first.  It&#8217;s going to take about 8 minutes to get the dough where it needs to be.  Add more flour only if the dough starts sticking to the table and there is no more dry flour to be worked into the dough.  You want the dough to end up smooth and elastic, and slightly tacky, but not sticky.  You should be able to knead it on a bare table without it sticking.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the kneading and cutting process, so you can see the stages the dough goes through.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4550120&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/4550120">Cinnamon Buns</a></p>
<p>Once the dough is ready, place it in an oiled bowl, covered with oiled plastic wrap, to rise for 90 minutes in a warm spot.  If you&#8217;re lacking a warm spot, turn your oven on low for 1 minute, then turn it off and place the dough in the oven to rise with the door closed.  Remember to turn the oven off after one minute, and remember the dough is in there &#8212; no preheating for other things! (I&#8217;ve made that mistake more than once, it&#8217;s never good.)</p>
<p>Once the dough has risen completely, it&#8217;ll leave a little dent when you poke it.  If it springs back, it needs more time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947303/" title="Risen Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3510947303_c2fc90c201.jpg" width="450" alt="Risen Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and press it down (this is part is in the video above).  You want it press or roll it out into a 15 x 20 inch rectangle.  You can use a roller if you want, but it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Pour the 1/2 cup of melted earth balance on the dough.  Brush it so the dough is covered completely.  It&#8217;s okay if it pools in some locations.</p>
<p>Mix together the cinnamon and sugar from the dough filling above.  Sprinkle it evenly over the dough. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947379/" title="Cinnamon Sugar Filling by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/3510947379_2db606b531.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Sugar Filling" /></a></p>
<p>Prepare a large baking dish, like a lasagna dish, by pouring in the melted earth balance from the pan sauce ingredients above.  Brush the sides of the pan so they are greased.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947207/" title="Melted Earth Balance by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3510947207_9f6a344cb8.jpg" width="450" alt="Melted Earth Balance" /></a></p>
<p>Add the sugar, spreading evenly over the bottom of pan.  The pan is now ready for the buns.</p>
<p>The following steps are shown in detail in the video above:  Roll the dough up gently, starting from one of the short sides.  Let it rest on the seem once it&#8217;s rolled up completely.  Cut 12 rolls with dental floss or sewing thread.  Place the rolls in the pan.  (Ignore the fact that they are practically floating in earth balance and sugar.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947437/" title="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3510947437_0f43140f93.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Buns, pre-baked" /></a></p>
<p>Cover the buns and let rise for 45 minutes if you will be baking these immediately.  If baking the next day, cover the buns and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.  Bake in the morning with no need for more rising.  If making the buns for a date in the future, cover the buns and freeze immediately.  The day before you are ready to use them, defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then let warm up on the counter the next morning for an hour.  In any case, when ready to bake, follow the directions below.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350ยบ F, remembering to remove the rising buns if they are in there!</p>
<p>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.  Let cool for a few minutes.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3510947489/" title="Cinnamon Buns, baked by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3510947489_405363645e.jpg" width="450" alt="Cinnamon Buns, baked" /></a></p>
<p>Stir together the frosting ingredients.  It takes a bit of elbow grease to mix it together, but resist the urge to add liquid.  It will come together, I promise.  Whisk until there are no lumps.</p>
<p>Serve the buns warm with frosting.  I like to microwave completely cooled buns for 45-60 seconds before eating.</p>
<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3444639377/" title="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3544/3444639377_55edd595bc.jpg" width="450" alt="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies" /></a></p>
<p>I always have trouble finding vegan graham crackers at the store.  Nearly every single brand has honey in them.  The one version that doesn&#8217;t is full of icky ingredients.  </p>
<p>When I got my <a href="http://www.dandiescandies.com/">Dandies</a> in the mail, I knew I had to make my own graham crackers once and for all.  The recipe turned out really good.  I&#8217;d like to perfect the texture a little (ideally, I&#8217;d actually like them to be <i>more</i> crumbly than they are), but the flavor is nice and mellow, and it really highlights the sweet, nutty taste of whole wheat without being overly sugary.  If you like your graham crackers really sweet, add a bit more sugar than I call for.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3445457388/" title="Graham Crackers by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3445457388_8e650daf93_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Graham Crackers" /></a>Graham crackers are traditionally made with graham flour, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Graham">Sylvester Graham</a>, a really interesting (if slightly crazy) health nut from the 19th century.  He promoted the vegetarian diet (yay!) to cure, among other things, sexual desires (I did say he was slightly crazy).</p>
<p>Graham flour is whole wheat flour.  What makes it different from standard whole wheat is the ratio of endosperm to bran to germ.  Sylvester Graham ground these parts of the wheat berry separately to preserve texture and then re-combined them in a specific proportion.  You can find graham flour in some stores and online, or you can make your own.  Wikipedia says &#8220;one cup of graham flour is approximately equivalent to 84 g (~2/3 cup) white flour, 15 g (slightly less than 1/3 cup) wheat bran, and 2.5 g (1.5 teaspoons) wheat germ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you can do what I did and just use stoneground flour and call it a day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3445457040/" title="Stoneground Whole Wheat Flour by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3445457040_8fe50d8bf5_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Stoneground Whole Wheat Flour" /></a>Actually, you can use whatever flour you like for these.  I used stoneground flour because it has little flecks of bran in it, which adds some lovely texture to the crackers.  I really recommend using at least some form of whole wheat, because it gives the graham crackers their traditional nutty flavor.  Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s healthier.  And rest assured it won&#8217;t mess with your libido.  Sorry Sylvester. </p>
<p>Graham crackers are tasty, but they aren&#8217;t the sexiest food in the world.  S&#8217;mores, on the other hand?  Sexy.  I made these with Chicago Soydairy&#8217;s latest vegan treat, <A href="http://www.dandiescandies.com/">Dandies vegan marshmallows</a>.  They are awesome!  It&#8217;s my understanding that they&#8217;re being sold online, but sell out FAST. So if you see them available, scoop them up!  They taste great, and they&#8217;re gelatin free, and they roast up just like the non-vegan version.  Perfect for s&#8217;mores.</p>
<p>How about a little video before the recipe?  Don&#8217;t forget all my videos are HD, so you can watch them full-screen!</p>

<p><strong>Graham Crackers</strong><br />
<em>Makes at least 24 3&#215;3&#8243; Crackers</em></p>
<p>2 1/2 Cups Graham Flour or Stoneground Flour or Whole Wheat Flour<br />
1 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
1/2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1 tsp Salt<br />
1 tsp Cinnamon<br />
1/2 Cup Earth Balance Margarine<br />
1/4 Cup Dark Brown Sugar<br />
1 tsp Vanilla Extract<br />
1/4 Cup Agave Nectar (or a little more sugar mixed with water)<br />
3/4 Cup Water</p>
<p>Mix the all the dry ingredients together.  Cream together Earth Balance and sugar.  Add vanilla and agave and beat with a whisk until smooth.  Add a little of the flour and a little of the water to the earth balance/sugar mixture and combine.  Continue adding in flour and water, a little at a time, until all flour and water is added.  Work the dough with your hands until everything is evenly combined.</p>
<p>Divide dough in half and cover.  Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  </p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325ยบ F.  Roll out the dough into a rectangle that measures approximately 11&#8243;x15&#8243;.  Trim edges.  Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into squares or rectangles (I cut mine into 3&#8242;x3&#8242; squares).  Prick the squares with a fork.</p>
<p>Bake for 30-40 minutes at 325ยบ F or until the crackers are turning golden brown around the edges.  You can sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top of the crackers during the last 10 minutes of baking if you like.</p>
<p>Remove from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack.  See the video above for visual directions.</p>
<p><strong>For S&#8217;mores</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3444639257/" title="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3444639257_afe856a259.jpg" width="450" alt="S'mores with Homemade Graham Crackers and Dandies" /></a></p>
<p>Place the crackers in multiples of two on a baking sheet and preheat the oven to broil.  Add chocolate to one cracker and vegan marshmallows to another until all the crackers are topped.  Broil for less than 1 minute, watching constantly, until the marshmallows are golden and melty and the chocolate has softened. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3444639175/" title="Chicago Soydairy's Dandies Marshmallows by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3444639175_591c316f96.jpg" width="450" alt="Chicago Soydairy's Dandies Marshmallows" /></a></p>
<p>Remove from oven, assemble the s&#8217;more, and eat!  The graham crackers are also great plain, or topped with cream cheese frosting. </p>

<p>I asked my <a href="http://twitter.com/littleturkey">twitter</a> friends if they&#8217;d like to see recipes made for one, and the response was overwhelming; absolutely.  A lot of you seem to make lunch for yourself, or have several weeknights where you&#8217;re cooking solo and want to throw something fresh together without a lot of hassel.  </p>
<p>When I know I&#8217;m going to be eating alone, I rarely do the logical thing and make a big batch of something so I can have leftovers.  I&#8217;m <em>terrible</em> with leftovers.  I&#8217;m too fickle when it comes to food, so leftovers turn to science projects in the fridge.  Therefore I tend to make a lot of one-off meals based on whatever odds and ends of produce I have left.  </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s one of them.  I had one serving broccolini, and half a pint of cherry tomatoes.  Not enough of either to feed both me and my husband, so I made one little but delicious meal out of it.  If you&#8217;re not cooking for one, this dish is easy to scale up, so don&#8217;t worry.  But my friends who dine independently?  This one is especially for you!</p>
<p>Annnd, how about a video?  Here&#8217;s the whole meal, start to finish, in two minutes.  A little overview, if you will.  There&#8217;s nothing difficult about this recipe, so this is more for fun than anything.  You can watch the whole video in HD, full-screen, even!</p>

<p><strong>Broccolini, Cherry Tomato and Butter Bean Udon</strong><br />
<em>Serves One</em></p>
<p>1 to 1 1/2 Bundles Udon Noodles<br />
Oil, about 2-3 Tbs<br />
3-6 Stalks of Broccolini, depending on size<br />
1/2 tsp Red Pepepr Flakes<br />
Black Pepper<br />
Salt<br />
10 Cherry Tomatoes, quartered<br />
1/2 Cup Butter Beans/Lima Beans, drained and rinsed<br />
1-2 tsp Italian Herbs<br />
Balsamic Vinegar, for drizzling</p>
<p>Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add udon noodles and cook for four minutes (or as long as package directions dictate), then drain and rinse well.  Coat lightly with oil to prevent noodles from sticking.  I use spray oil for this, I think it&#8217;s the easiest and you use the least amount of oil.  Set noodles aside.</p>
<p>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium high with a little oil.  Add broccolini and coat with oil.  Season with 1 big pinch of salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Once the broccolini starts to turn bright green and get a little color (just a minute or two), push them to the edge of the pan.  </p>
<p>Turn heat up a little and add quartered cherry tomatoes. Stir to coat in any oil/spices leftover from the broccolini, then let cook, untouched, to get a little color and soften up, 1-2 minutes.  Once tomatoes are softened, add 1/2 cup of butter beans.  Stir everything together and remove to a bowl.</p>
<p>In the still-hot pan, add a 1-2 Tbs more oil.  Add cooked udon noodles to the hot pan, seasoning with a pinch of salt and italian herbs. Toss to coat the pasta.  Once the pasta is coated and is heated through, add back the broccolini, beans, and tomatoes.  Taste and season with more salt or pepper if needed.</p>
<p>Plate, and drizzle with balsamic vinegar if desired.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000930/" title="Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3329000930_fdecdd4135_o.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>I first encountered daifuku at one of my favorite restaurants in Western Massachusetts, <A href="http://freshsideamherst.com/">Fresh Side</a>.  In their deli case were these cute little white and green pillow-looking desserts, sitting behind a hand-written card that said: Mochi (vegan).</p>
<p>I ordered one and when I bit into it, it was such a surprise.  First, the texture!  It&#8217;s like a dense marshmallow, chewy and soft.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  Next, the filling.  Beans.  Beans?  Beans.  This particular mochi was fillied with a sweetened red bean paste, also called anko, and I think it was the first time I had ever had sweet beans.  And it was really good!</p>
<p>Now, if I understand correctly, mochi is a catch-all term for a sweet dessert made with glutenous rice flour dough.  It can be baked, wrapped around ice cream, eaten plain, or filled.  Filled mochi, like the ones I&#8217;m blogging about today, are called daifuku.  </p>
<p>Anko is one of the most common fillings, but many people also use berries.  Strawberry filled ones are very popular in the spring, and they&#8217;re called ichigo daifuku.  Whole raspberries also work, and sometimes people include a white sweetened bean paste (as opposed to red) known as shiroan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000898/" title="Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3329000898_e70bc58f88.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Now what if I told you that I made these in the microwave?</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>I was skeptical, too.  The microwave in my house is pretty much reserved for reheating leftovers.  When I decided to make these, I was sort of shocked that all the recipes online called for nuking the dough.  What&#8217;s more, they were pretty unclear about how to tell when you&#8217;re dough is ready.  Microwaves seem to vary so much in power, 3 minutes in one microwave is very different than 3 minutes in another.  But I decided to give it a go, and not only did it work, but it was really, really easy.  If you are able to find pre-made red bean paste, you can make this whole recipe with only a microwave and just a few minutes. </p>
<p>So not only do you not need a kitchen for these (hello dorm-living vegans!), they&#8217;re also gluten free (hi celiacs!), soy free (hi soy&#8230;allergic lovelies!), fast (hi lazy people!), customizable (hi picky people!), and did I mention CUTE?  Traditional colors are white, green, and pink, but food coloring isn&#8217;t required if it grosses you out.  Matcha (green tea powder) is a natural and delicious flavoring that makes the mochi green.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165909/" title="Mochiko by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3328165909_4159851a76_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 3px" alt="Mochiko" /></a>Now the one thing you absolutely need, no substitutions, is mochiko.  It&#8217;s glutenous rice flour, and no other flour will work for this.  You can find it easily at any asian market.</p>
<p>Also make sure you have some cornstarch or potato starch handy, the dough is very sticky!</p>
<p><strong>Daifuku</strong><br />
<em>Makes 10-12 Filled Cakes</em></p>
<p>1 Cup Mochiko<br />
1/4 Cup Sugar<br />
2/3 Cup Water<br />
2-3 Drops red or green food coloring, optional<br />
Cornstarch or Potato Starch, for dusting</p>
<p><em>Filling Ideas</em><br />
Anko (store bought or recipe below)<br />
Strawberries<br />
Raspberries</p>
<p><strong>Anko</strong><br />
<em>Makes enough for 3-4 batches of daifuku</em></p>
<p>1 14 oz Can Adzuki Beans<br />
1/2 Cup Water<br />
1 Cup Sugar<br />
1 Tbs Vegetable Oil<br />
1-2 Pinches Salt</p>
<p>Heat water and sugar separately until boiling and sugar is dissolved, turn off heat.  Drain and rinse beans.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000762/" title="Adzuki Beans by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3329000762_0332e4c645.jpg" width="450" alt="Adzuki Beans" /></a></p>
<p>Add to a pan and mash.  Add 1/3 cup of the simple syrup you just made, along with salt and vegetable oil, and mash over medium heat.  Beans will thicken and become slightly glossy.  Add more syrup if desired.  Turn out into a bowl and let cool.</p>
<p><em>Making the Mochi</em></p>
<p>Add the mochiko, sugar, water, and food coloring (if using) to a microwave safe bowl.  Stir well, making sure there are no lumps.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as best you can with a rubber spatula, otherwise they&#8217;ll get all gross when the dough is microwaved.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165939/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3317/3328165939_f2de866948.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Cover lightly with plastic wrap and mircowave for 2 minutes.  Remove bowl from the microwave and stir VERY well.  Dough will be much thicker, but there should still be some raw parts underneath.  I like to use a sturdy silicone spatula to mix the dough at this point.  Place the dough back in the microwave for 1 more minute.  </p>
<p>Open the door and peek&#8211;did the dough start sinking as soon as the door opened?  If so, the dough was inflating while cooking, which means it&#8217;s ready.  If not, microwave for 1 more minute and check again.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to microwave for more than 4 minutes total (2 minutes initial cooking, 2 more additional minutes after mixing).</p>
<p>One the dough deflates when you open the door, remove the dough from the microwave and scrape it out onto a cornstarch-coated cutting board.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3328165993/" title="Daifuku Dough by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3328165993_981b983f39.jpg" width="450" alt="Daifuku Dough" /></a></p>
<p>Pat the hot dough (be careful! It&#8217;s hot!) with cornstarch and flatten it out a little.  Cut into 10-12 even pieces.  Add 1 tsp of filling to each piece and gently press the edges together to seal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/3329000858/" title="Making Daifuku by teenytinyturkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3542/3329000858_0f09123ef8.jpg" width="450" alt="Making Daifuku" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the whole process in a little HD video for you to watch!  No sound, so don&#8217;t worry about turning down the volume if you&#8217;re at work. The video starts right after I took the dough out of the mircowave and dumped it onto the cutting board.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="253"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473920&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=00ADEF&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="253"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/3473920">Making Daifuku</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to keep these fresh is to individually wrap them in plastic wrap and then refrigerate.  If you leave them out, unwrapped, they&#8217;ll get dry and tough.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>Remember when I made <a href="../../../2007/01/mini-doughnuts/index.html">mini-donuts </a>and promised you a recipe?  And then never gave you one?  Well, today I decided to keep my word.  I got up, made some tea, and set to work.  My house is covered in donuts!</p>
<p>My first attempt wasn&#8217;t a <em>complete</em> failure, but I wasn&#8217;t happy with the result.  They didn&#8217;t rise very well, leaving one side of each donut flat and craggy.  It&#8217;s not that I expected a recipe I made up to work on the first try, but I was still hoping to get lucky.</p>
<p>I did get lucky on my second try.  I reduced the fat content and upped the soy milk and the baking powder.  Success!  They rose much better, had a nicer texture, and were prettier.  Here are the two tries side-by-side:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398945600/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/139/398945600_cb43a5b0f4.jpg" alt="Difference Between Tester Recipes" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Much better, huh?  Below is the recipe for the donuts and the glaze, directions for glaze, pictures of the whole process, and even a video.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention?  There&#8217;s chocoalte coated ones, too!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/399056969/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/399056969_ca2841ffeb.jpg" width="450" alt="Chocolate Dipper Donut, Halved" /></a><br />
<span id="more-124"></span></p>
<p><strong>Mini Baked Donuts</strong><br />
<em>Make 20 Donuts</em></p>
<p><em>Dry Ingredients</em>:<br />
1 Cup All Purpose Flour<br />
1/2 Cup Sugar<br />
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder<br />
1/4 tsp Salt<br />
1/4 tsp (scant) Nutmeg<br />
1 tiny pinch or shake Cinnamon</p>
<p><em>Wet Ingredients</em>:<br />
1/2 Cup Soymilk<br />
1/2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar<br />
1/2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract<br />
Egg Replacer for 1 Egg<br />
4 Tbs Earth Balance</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350รยบ F</p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients with a whisk to mix thoroughly.  Combine wet ingredients in a small sauce pan over medium low heat and mix until earth balance is melted.  This mixture should NOT get too hot, you should be able to stick your finger in the mixture.  It should feel slightly warm.  If you burn yourself, 1) it&#8217;s not my fault! and 2) it&#8217;s too hot for the dough!</p>
<p>Add wet to dry and mix until just combined.  It should form a very soft dough.  Like this:</p>
<p><object height="350" width="425"></object></p>
<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/BqRMN3Qr8Pc"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/BqRMN3Qr8Pc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398944623/">Click for photo of the same</a>.</p>
<p>Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out dough into your ungreased nonstick mini-donut pan.  Smooth out the top of the dough with your fingers, this will make for more even, prettier donuts, but isn&#8217;t crucial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398944017/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/165/398944017_c6e3ea9e31.jpg" alt="Donuts Before Baking" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the dough sits just below the rim.  If you over fill, your donuts will come out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398946110/">looking like it has a little muffin top</a>.  Not the end of the world, but not very donut-like either.</p>
<p>Bake for 12 minutes.  They should not be browned on top, but a tester will come out clean.  Invert hot pan over a cutting board or cooling rack to release donuts.  Allow to cool completely before decorating.</p>
<p>Time for toppings!</p>
<p><strong>Glaze with Sprinkles</strong><br />
1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar (lump free!)<br />
1 Tbs Soymilk<br />
Bowl full of sprinkles (1/4 to 1/2 cup, ish?)</p>
<p>Whisk soymilk and powdered sugar together.  Dip the &#8220;bottom&#8221; half of the donut (the side with the nicer shape) into the glaze, let some drip off, then dip glaze-side down into sprinkles.  Transfer to a wire rack that has been set on top of some parchment paper.  The excess glaze will drip through the rack onto the paper for easy cleaning later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398946563/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/398946563_25c412206f_m.jpg" alt="Glaze Dip" height="180" width="240" /></a><br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398949715/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/398949715_a0218e7de2_m.jpg" alt="Mini Donut with Sprinkles" height="180" width="240" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Chocolate Dip</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part.  Melt 6 oz of high quality fairly sweet chocolate over low heat in a double boiler.  Remove from heat and stir until chocolate is smooth and barely warm to the touch.  I should mention that you should be very careful not to get any water in the chocolate or it could seize, and no one likes that!</p>
<p>Dip your donuts one-by-one into the chocolate until completely covered.  Place donut on your wire rack to drip off excess chocolate &#8211; it&#8217;ll make for a much smoother appearance than if you try to scrape off excess chocoalte with your fingers.  Allow to set until chocolate isn&#8217;t so shiny and can be picked up without making a sticky mess!</p>
<p>*Edit!!  So, I waited until the chocolate was set and realized that my donuts had glued themselves to the rack, making the bottoms rip off when your try to pick one up.  I think it&#8217;d be better to let these set on parchment paper!  Also, use a decently sweet chocolate, mine was too bitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/398948239/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/125/398948239_d670f175a0.jpg" alt="Mini Chocolate Dipped Donuts" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
