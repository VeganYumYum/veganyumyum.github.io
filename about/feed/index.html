		<description>Hello, I was wondering how you felt about apricots. They&#039;re my favorite fruit and I don&#039;t know how to use them. I eat them and make them into a sauce. Other than being a great face scrub what else can they do? If you have any ideas e-mail me or post something lovely here.

Oh can you kind of explain what earth balance is. I&#039;ve googled it and received missed messages.


P.S. Since you live in Boston too have you ever eaten cranberries and sliced apricots with a little sugar? Try it. It&#039;s weird but the second time you try it you might just love it.</description>

		<description>Do you ever do anything gluten free?  I have celiac disease and most of the packaged mixes you can buy for baked goods are downright digusting.  I also love to bake and am used to home-made items.  I was one of the few kids in this world that didn&#039;t like Twinkies and things like that growing up.  I made a batch of cupcakes using a mix a while back and after eating a half of one I tossed the entire batch in the trash.  If you could create tasty gluten-free bakery items there are thousands of us celiacs that would be eternally grateful.

thanks</description>

		<description>Hello-
I am with my company this week at Natural Products Expo sampling our imported vegan cheese from Scotland called Sheese.  Several folks asked me if I had heard of this blog and or you had heard about Sheese for your recipes.  
I spent this morning before the show looking over the delicious recipes, so thanks very much for all your hard work.

We&#039;ve been getting some good reviews about Sheese, so if you&#039;d like to try some in your recipes, we&#039;d be gald to send you a sample pack.

Regards,
Scott Myers</description>

		<description>Hello!

I just wanted to drop a note to say I&#039;ve enjoyed your blog and it inspired me to start my own at http://frogfood.peace.net

One problem I am having is getting decent photos.  I have dozens of pictures of delicious food that just don&#039;t look good enough to post.  And as you can see, even the ones I have aren&#039;t fabulous.  I have a decent camera, but it seems to fail miserably anytime the flash is needed.  Can you tell me something about your photo set-up and how you get such gorgeous pictures?  Thanks. :)</description>

		<description>I just experimented with beets for my very first time-- canned beets had me scared for years. 1. Preheat your oven to 425. 2. Get fresh, organic ones. 3. Quarter them (or cut them into eighths if they&#039;re big). You can cut off any bad spots or peel them if you wish. 4. Lay them in a pan. 5. Add a clove (or two) of freshly-crushed garlic, salt &amp; pepper. 6. Toss it all in a bit of drizzled oil. 7. Cover in foil. 8. Bake for 10 minutes. 9. Bake for another 7-10 minutes uncovered until a bit dried. Voila. They&#039;re great hot and just fine cold as well. Lolo, you have to try this and see what you think. They&#039;re quite photogenic as well. (Save the greens-- they can be used in any recipe that calls for kale).</description>
