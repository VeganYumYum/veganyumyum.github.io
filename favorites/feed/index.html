		<description>I don&#039;t know where you&#039;ve been all my life, but I want to marry your recipes!
After 3 years of clean, vegan eating I was led astray for almost a decade, wondering if I could ever break my processed/animal-product-based food addictions again. 
Yes, as a matter of fact. I now try to eat at as much raw vegan as I can, and green smoothies play an essential part of this, but finally, some truly fantastic cooked-vegan recipes. 
I&#039;m ordering your book. 
Outstanding, thank you!</description>

		<description>I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re back! I went from veg to vegan about 3 years ago, and vegan yum yum helped me through some tough times, especially in the beginning. There are a lot of bad vegan recipes out there (soggy tofu turkey, anyone?) and finding your blog gave me much needed hope and inspiration to actually eat vegan food that I could be proud of, and even pique the interest of my omni friends! :) The book and the website both have such a wealth of information that has been a constant resource for me. I have discovered a lot of other great vegan bloggers and authors since you, and honestly none of them stack up to you! The way you use your gorgeous photos to tell the &quot;story&quot; of the recipe is so succinct, but with such respect for the aesthetic, each recipe (or post) conveys the experience of the cooking process with exactly what it needs and nothing it doesn&#039;t.  You are truly gifted and I am so grateful for the work you do!</description>

		<description>Hi Lolo! I discovered your website a few months ago and bought your book. I wouldn&#039;t enjoy being vegan quite as much without your amazing recipes. Thank you so much!!</description>

		<description>I am trying to join your blog as I have had your book for a couple of years and love your recipes. My own food blog is not vegan but I have been leaning that way more and more and now want to take the next step. I can&#039;t seem to find anywhere to follow your blog?
Please let me know how I can subscribe
Thanks,
Belinda</description>

		<description>Superfoods are very much in vogue these days, but sometimes people just don&#039;t know which one to go for. I understand that Wheatgrass is a very good superfood, so if you want to find out more (and perhaps get some recipies and more data) then can I suggest you check out www.wheatgrass-uk.com.</description>
