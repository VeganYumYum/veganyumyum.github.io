		<description>Brilliant idea to put the roasted tomatoes in an inside-out basil leaf! I am starting basil seeds under lights very shortly (for the winter indoor herb garden), and the only fresh tomatoes worth spending ANY money on in the winter are cherry tomatoes- and even then, it&#039;s a crapshoot. Canapes for Christmas, perhaps?</description>

		<description>These look incredible!  They remind me of bruschetta with a slightly different twist.  I can&#039;t wait to try the recipe.</description>

		<description>What a beautiful treat to the eyes and taste buds too. I am going to make it today.
I happened to come across your blog two months back and was very sad to see that there were no recent posts and today I thought of checking it again for a vegan cake recipe and what I see...&quot;you are back&quot; Couldn&#039;t have been happier.
Thanks a lot for the wonderful blog.</description>
