		<description>This looks great!  Finally, something I can do with roasted, salted seeds- something I always have on hand.  BTW, glad to see you&#039;re back!  I can&#039;t tell you how many times I stared at your Avocado Wasabi Salad, thinking, &quot;Why&#039;d you leave meeeeee?&quot;</description>

		<description>Yay!!!  I am SO glad to see you back!  I was planning dinner, checked into your site at work because I don&#039;t have my cookbook with me and was so surprised to see your recent post that I also got a little teary-eyed.  Your cookbook is the best!  we keep it on the counter all the time, because it&#039;s beautiful and because we use it pretty much everyday.  All the best to you.</description>
