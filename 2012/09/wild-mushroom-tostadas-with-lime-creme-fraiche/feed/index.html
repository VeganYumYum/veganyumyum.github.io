		<description>I bought a little mushroom brush about the size of a business card and with lots of rubbery tentacles, and it works surprisingly well getting off the dirt.</description>

		<description>This looks delicious! I had the pickled carrots today alongside some black eyed peas with carmelized leeks and dijon-y greens, and they were SO good - I can&#039;t wait to try them with these tostadas!</description>

		<description>These look fantastic!  I absolutely adore mushrooms, but I rarely splurge on the wild ones because (as you said), they can be so dang expensive...  That was really interesting information about wild vs. cultivated and how that affects the price.  Perhaps I can justify the expense a little more now.
I am so, so, SO happy you are back, Lolo.  You come up with the best dishes, and your photos are so beautiful.  I missed you while you were on hiatus!  Your cookbook is one of my favorites, and it&#039;s just awesome that you&#039;re back with new recipes.</description>
