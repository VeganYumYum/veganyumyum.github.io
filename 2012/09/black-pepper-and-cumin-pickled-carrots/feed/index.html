		<description>Wow. I cannot fathom a cook who does not like garlic, since it is one of the most fundamental ingredients in savory cuisine from virtually every region of the world. How on earth do you sample ethnic food and simultaneously avoid garlic? Well I give you credit for cooking with cilantro at least.</description>

		<description>I love the spice house! I recognized that bottle right away haha. I have many many of their spices. Sometimes online ordering is easier when youre not in the mood to go scavenger hunting for every spice under the sun</description>

		<description>HOORAY!!! SHE&#039;S BACK!!! I discovered your dormant blog last year as I was transitioning from meat-eater to vegan. I so enjoy your cookbook, Lolo--especially your Smoky Miso Tofu. Dear Lord. I bought a Silpat baking mat just for that, and I have no regrets.

SO, you&#039;re from Illinois?! I know where the Spice House is! Did you frequent the one in Evanston or Chicago? Or Geneva (if you&#039;re one of the poor souls who didn&#039;t grow up in the Chicagoland area)?</description>

		<description>Glad you are back. I didn&#039;t realize you are from Illinois. Cool! :-) I don&#039;t have many foods on my blacklist, but I do try to get out of food ruts. My eldest is a pickle fiend and would probably adore these carrots.</description>

		<description>Excellent, thanks for that. And yes, they were lovely. I&#039;m making more tonight, so I can give the wild mushroom recipe a go over the weekend.

I&#039;ve never understood why someone would eat a pickle before now.</description>
