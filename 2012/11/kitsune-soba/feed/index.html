		<description>All about noodle bowls during these cold, cold months. But! Wheat irritates my belly. Hopefully brown rice (stir fry-type) noodles will suffice.</description>

		<description>I make a similar broth with kombu, dried mushrooms, fresh ginger, scallions, toasted sesame oil and tamari. I fry my tofu in coconut oil after seasoning it with garlic. Yours looks great! Nice photos!</description>

		<description>This looks wonderful! I too have found that ginger is really lovely in broth soups, and this looks great for an autumn/winter recipe.</description>

		<description>Have you tried cooking the noodles with the broth? It appears much simpler that way.  BTW I&#039;m so happy you are back! I&#039;ve missed you. I can&#039;t wait for more of your easy fun recipes and maybe even a new cookbook....</description>

		<description>Hey Kathryn!  I pressed the slices briefly, after cutting, on paper towels.  I literally placed them on a doubled paper towel and then pressed down with my hands on top with another paper towel for just a few seconds - so it wasn&#039;t a formal pressing.  You choose not to press them and it will work fine, but they will take slightly longer to cook.</description>
