		<description>This was so good!  I used a teaspoon of paprika and turmeric in place of the recado powder but still, the best sauce I have ever had!  I put this with some fresh salsa and spinach and rolled it up in one of the best burritos I have ever had.  Thanks so much for this recipe!</description>

		<description>How funny, I was flipping through your recipes and ran across this one! I am from Belize, and I don&#039;t know which chicken recipe specifically you were talking about, because we use recado in a lot of dishes, but I am guessing it was the ubiquitious Stewed Chicken. Everyone has their own version of this recipe, but none of the ones that I know about have citrus juices or tamari (tamari? Whats that?) in them. On the other hand, some people do use worchesterchire sauce, which I know isnt vegetarian or vegan, so tamari sauce might make a decent vegan substitute. 

I&#039;ve added you to my blog roll and will have to try this recipe with some of my recado from Belize.  As I am not vegetarian, I will be happy to let you know if it tastes like Belizean stew chicken. 

Did you know that there is also a pitch black recado mix as well? Traditionally the black color comes from blackened and ground corn tortillas, and the achiote (we call it annato) is blended with that and some very spicy other additions. It is the spiciest recado around. 

Your blog is beautiful, and your photos are too. You are right about not putting bad pics up, I am guilty of that because I dont have good night lighting and work during the day, so I sometimes take bad pics and then I post them anyways. I may have to start taking those down though...</description>

		<description>These turned out so fantastic just now, I&#039;m raving about the recipe to all my friends, veggie and omnivorous alike. I threw a handful of chopped onions in with the seitan and let them bake together - they absorbed lots of flavor and softened up nicely.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the kind comments!

Mihi - What a coincidence!  I hope you enjoy the recipe!

Pamela - I&#039;ve linked to you for ages, dear!  Glad to see your updates!

Alex - These beans were a mix of whole and refried, with cumin, salt, pepper, and tomatoes.

Johanna - Interesting!  I&#039;ll have to keep my eyes peeled for the herb!</description>
