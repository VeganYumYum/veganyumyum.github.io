		<description>Neither my husband or I had ever enjoyed fiddleheads so we purchased some at Whole Foods. The sign said to either steam or saute then serve with olive oil and lemon. So we sauted them.  My husband was fine but within several hours I was VERY sick, which continued all night. I have no allergies and can&#039;t imagine why they did not agree with me. I enjoy all types of food and although they tasted very good, I won&#039;t be eating them again any time soon.</description>

		<description>I grew up slogging through the mud and creek beds looking for these scrumptious delicacies in northeastern NY state.  Now, transplated to Washington, DC...I am forlorn and lonely for my favorite veggie.  I&#039;ll pay if somebody can tell me where to go picking in the Maryland region.</description>

		<description>Picking fiddleheads is a family tradition here in Maine.  We are fortunate to pick them right here on our own property.  We steam our fiddleheads  in either bacon or salt pork to bring out the flavor wtih kosher salt and freshly grated pepper.  Drain and drizzle with champagne vinegar and butter more salt and pepper and serve steaming hot.  Some of our other favorite ways to serve them are iin a quiche, cream of fiddlehead soup and a spring fiddlehead puff whiich is my favorite way to serve them ~ here&#039;s the recipe: toast 6 homemade bread slices on one side in broiler.  Place slices of cheddar cheese on each untoasted side.  Broil to partially melt cheese.  Place some hot cooked fiddleheads on top of cheese.  Beat 3 egg yolks until thick.  Stir in 1/4 cup of mayonaise, a dollop of djon mustard and some kosher salt and pepper to taste.  Fold in 3 beaten egg whites.  Pile on top of fiddleheads.  Bake 350 oven about 12 minutes.</description>
