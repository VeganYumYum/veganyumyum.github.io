		<description>This looks great!  I was wondering what you considered a serving?  1 cup? 1/2 cup? A certain # of grams?  Thanks!</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been vegan for a little over a year now I have just recently found your website. I also have a daughter who has been vegan since she&#039;s had food. I was worried when I made this dish she would have to have an emergency ab&amp;j.  She happens to not just like but love it,  this dish is a new 17month olds favorite literally licked the bowl.</description>

		<description>Two things - first, this looks super yummy!  I&#039;ve never made my own Indian food from scratch, I always end up taking the dump-sauce-out-of-a-jar route, but I think I could manage this.  Second... did the peas get lost in there somewhere?</description>
