		<description>YUM.  I made this for dinner last night and it was absolutely delicious.  I&#039;m vegetarian, but striving to make more of my foods vegan.  This was a great dish with lots of flavor.  It was super easy to prepare and fast too, which means I&#039;ll be serving it up for dinner guests at some point.  Thanks!</description>

		<description>Hi,

I have fallen in love with your blog over the past 3-4 months and have tried out two recipes.

This time, I absolutely had to write in and tell you - I made the pesto arugula pesto pasta this week and it seems to have become my 18 month old daughter&#039; s favorite food :-) She was jumping up and down in her high chair demanding seconds (and thirds)!!

Cheers,
-Debs</description>

		<description>Fantastic.  I made this for dinner last night, and wanted to continue eating it for days.  I couldn&#039;t acquire broccolini, so used one stalk of broccoli, trimmed into nice slim florets.  I blanched them for about 30 seconds, then sauteed them in olive oil until they were tender &amp; browned.  Oh! And using fresh pasta made it even better.  Thanks!</description>
