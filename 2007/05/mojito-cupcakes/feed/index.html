		<description>I just made these and they were fantastic.  My only comment is that for me the icing ended up tasting kind of plain; next time I&#039;ll add more lime juice and rum to it.  I used fresh mint and the flavor from that was really good!  Thanks for posting!</description>

		<description>I absolutely love the pictures.  I&#039;ve done a mojito cake before, but have been looking for a good recipe for mojito cupcakes that were different from what I had already been using.  Bangup job on the pictures and the lighting.</description>
