		<description>Holy amazing!
Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. WHY? Because I can make it sweet without getting called out on it. These crumpets were amazing. Thanks!</description>

		<description>Lolo - just tried this recipe from your book yesterday. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE TROUBLESHOOTING PAGE!!

My first two crumpets were a disaster - batter too thick and heat too low (the birds were happy about that, lol), but the rest were great. Puffy, fluffy... The texture was perfect. Well done on this one!! :D</description>

		<description>These would be perfect with the jams and jellies I brought back from France last summer.  You can read about the confiturerie (jam shop) in this link.  I used the jam for hamentaschen (Jewish pastries for Purim) but they would be lovely on these crumpets as well:
