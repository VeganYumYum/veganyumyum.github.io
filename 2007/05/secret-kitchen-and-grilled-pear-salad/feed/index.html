		<description>found your website from a friends blog post.  I love it.  How can I learn more about you and do you have a cookbook?  I&#039;m especially interested in your yellow cupcake recipe and also the grilled pear recipe.  Everything looks great and it&#039;s making me hungry to keep reading :)</description>
