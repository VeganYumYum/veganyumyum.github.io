		<description>Did you make the gravy on the mashed potatoes? Or did you find a vegan brown gravy. I have been looking everywhere for a decent recipe and feel like I&#039;m getting nowhere. Thanks :]</description>

		<description>Lolo! You are just genius, woman. I&#039;m having carnivores over tomorrow for dinner and I&#039;m going to cook all of this up. I&#039;m a Texas girl born and raised and this is my kind of dinner! I would have never thought to whip up this exact combination, though. My mom makes &quot;smothered&quot; okra, which involves a similar recipe, but you put it in the oven instead....for anyone who&#039;s trying to keep away from the frying pan. 

Your blog inspires me to get into the kitchen. I can&#039;t wait for your cookbook!</description>

		<description>This looks perfect except for one thing: where the heck are the black eyed peas? Makes it the complete southern vegan meal and adds some protein to that plate:) I love black eyed peas, they have such a delicious flavour, melt in your mouth texture and lots of history. In Georgia, where my grandma is from, you cook black eyed peas on New Years day to bring in a good year. Usually served with rice, collard greens and a ham hock, but you can always leave out the ham:)</description>

		<description>yes, this georgia gal approves!  personally, i like roasted brussel sprouts, sprinkle with some balsamic vinegar, evoo, whatever dried spices you like, a couple of tsps of brown sugar, and throw them in the toaster oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  i didn&#039;t think this up, ironically it came from george duran&#039;s &#039;ham on the street&#039; show, but he does have some good veggie recipes at times</description>

		<description>Glad to see some southerner&#039;s approve!  Thanks everyone!

Rachel - The cornbread was good, but it wasn&#039;t great.  Once I get a recipe I really love I&#039;ll be sure to let you know if it&#039;s going on the blog or in the book!</description>

		<description>This all looks delicious!  Are we going to get any other recipes from this dinner, or are those for the book/zine?  I&#039;d love to make that cornbread.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve lived in Georgia almost all my 46 years, and I&#039;ve eaten a LOT of fried okra.  Never vegan though - this recipe sounds good.</description>
