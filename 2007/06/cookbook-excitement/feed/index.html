		<description>I can&#039;t wait for your cookbook to come out (I&#039;ve already put it on my Christmas list!). I especially want to try that Sheera. I used to eat something like that at a vegetarian lunch buffet when I went to university. I have been hankering after something like it for the last two years.</description>

Thanks, Betty Shah

		<description>When is your cookbook coming out? I want it ASAP!

My mom makes sheera, and it&#039;s delicious, and I can&#039;t wait to make it vegan. And everything else looks delicious too!</description>

		<description>Wow, I&#039;m really looking forward to this recipe book, and I&#039;m not even vegan. You blog is the first thing that ever convinced me that a person can be vegan and still have an interesting diet and it will be first on my gift list for two friends: one a vegetarian and the other who simply can&#039;t tolerate dairy. I think all three of us are going to be very happy with it, if the recipes I see here are anything to go by. :)</description>
