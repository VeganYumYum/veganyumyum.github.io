They are absolutely delicious and you can add sauces or toppings to make them look extra luscious!!!  You can even purchase them on their website!</description>

		<description>Hi Again,

Where do I go to find your recipe for the mini trifles?  Thank you so much.  I have a dinner party  on Thursday evening and this would be a great dessert.

&lt;em&gt;Hi there, this recipe isn&#039;t available yet as it&#039;s slated for my cookbook.  Sorry!  You can easily re-create it with any sponge cake/pound cake recipe, some preserves/jam/pie filling, and your favorite pudding.  Hope that helps.&lt;/em&gt;</description>
