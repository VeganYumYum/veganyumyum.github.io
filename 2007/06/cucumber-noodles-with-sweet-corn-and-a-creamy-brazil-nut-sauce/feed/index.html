		<description>this inspired me to free form my own version of a sauce using soaked sunflower seeds and a few brazil nuts for my base (more local to where I live in the midwest)--thanks for the motivation!  i used zucchini noodles, and heck, why not throw in a tomato.  delish.</description>

		<description>Your dish looks amazing. I am currently on a juice feast so I am not eating. When I was eating raw before that I used to make pad Thai with cucumber noodles. It was delicious especially on a hot summer day. The only down side is the water that gets released when you add the sauce. It seems like you had a good solution. Thanks so much!
