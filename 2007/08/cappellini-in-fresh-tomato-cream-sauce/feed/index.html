		<description>I just made this with spaghetti and put in some homemade wheat gluten &quot;chicken&quot;.
Needless to say, this is a keeper. It&#039;s like eating at an expensive italian restaurant, but at home! Superb, awesome, amazing, delicious recipe. Thanks a billion!</description>

		<description>Did anyone measure how many ounces this makes when they made it? I&#039;m trying to make lasagna and I need 16 oz of sauce, this sounds like the perfect one!</description>

		<description>I made this for dinner tonight and it was great! I used canned whole plum tomatoes (didn&#039;t have any fresh) and added fresh oregano and parsley. Keep up the great recipes!</description>

		<description>@Jennifer DeMent:
You have to look for the non-hydrogenated varieties: yellow container for cream cheese and blue for sour cream (Tofutti brand). There are other fake cream cheese and sour cream on the market as well (such as those made by Follow Your Heart).  Although better products, these non-hydrogenated varieties are still highly processed (but I still love them).</description>

		<description>I read the ingredients on tofutti better than sour cream and better than cream cheese - HYDROGENATED oil!!!!!  No ok in my book, but I&#039;m allergic to milk, so I need an alternative. Does anyone have any suggestions?  I want to try several recipes that call for heavy cream or other such ingredients. I also want to make truffles, and need to figure out what to use when the recipe calls for cream there - I tried pureeing tofu, but it doesn&#039;t ever get that smooth.  What would you suggest?</description>
