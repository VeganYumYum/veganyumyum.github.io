		<description>I&#039;ve been going through your recipes. I just became veg a little less than a year ago...and to tell you the truth, I&#039;m not a healthy one. I was hoping to find some meal recipes that might hide the taste of veggies..I was wrong..All I could look at was the desserts! Curse you!(; Then I saw this..and I LITTERALLY licked my lips..</description>

		<description>Flat out the best banana bread vegan or non-vegan ever!  Wonderful texture, not too heavy and  avery nice banana taste.  I made this in a large sized muffin pan and got six muffins with a domed top.  This is definitely finding a permanent spot in my recipe files.  Thanks for sharing.</description>

		<description>Made this yesterday for my sister&#039;s birthday (in a tube pan rather than a bundt pan, heh), and none of us could stop eating it.  So moist, so delicious!  I subbed one cup of WW pastry flour for one of the cups of regular flour and it was still amazing, and topped it with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was for my sister&#039;s birthday, and she loved it! :D</description>

		<description>I made this cake, but only had 1 banana on hand.  So I used the banana and about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of leftover steamed sweet potato that I had in the fridge.  The cake was a huge hit-not dry at all and with a firm exterior (like that of a muffin top)-YUM!</description>

You are a genius!

		<description>I just made this again, and since I only had a tablespoon of Tofutti sour supreme, I made up the rest with (plain) soy yogurt.  Worked very well.  I might add a squeeze of lemon next time for some added sour.</description>
