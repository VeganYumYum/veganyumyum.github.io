		<description>I am a &quot;make it yourself seitan&quot; newbie, found this recipe and can&#039;t wait to make it. My question is: at what stage do you proceed with this recipe? After rinsing and draining the seitan, do you simmer it in broth  and then follow the recipe, or do you start the recipe using the raw seitan? Thank you for your info... and recipe.</description>

		<description>I made this for the first time tonight and it was a huge hit. I had never made seitan before either so I wasn&#039;t quite sure how it would turn out. My uber carnivore boyfriend loved it and my roommate did too. Yayyy! It was a little too crispy but I blame the bad lighting in my kitchen.</description>

		<description>I made my own seitan and added some peanut butter to the &quot;dough&quot; then fried the seitan in a mix of sesame oil and vegetable oil... perfect! If you aren&#039;t a fan of seitan&#039;s &#039;wheaty&#039; flavor this sauce masks it nicely! We also toasted our sesame seeds before adding them to the dish and used lots and lots of them :) LOVE this one, will make again!!!

OH! and it IS easier to make than it looks! :D</description>

		<description>[...] Crispy Sweet and Sour Seitan or Crispy Sweet and Sour Tofu which is supposedly a close remake of The Grasshopper&#8217;s No Name (via VeganYumYum). If this tastes anything like sweet and sour chicken that ate in my pre-vegetarian days, then I am psyched to try this. I always try ordering things like this at Chinese restaurants but then I can only eat the crust of the tofu or seitan because the inside is too mushy. Maybe this will recipe will fix that. (Looking at the Tofu recipe, I would suggest smaller chunks of tofu if you want them to be less mushy on the inside, as I prefer.) [...]</description>

		<description>I made this tonight and it was pretty good, but I found the sauce to be a little too vinegary and it wasn&#039;t quite sweet enough.  Next time I am going to add more sugar and less vinegar.   I used the new sauce recipe, not the old one.

I used blackstrap molasses, and Wan Jah Shin rice vinegar, if that means anything.

The crispiness of the seitan was perfect.  I added the sliced almonds, which also turned out well.

Thanks for all the recipes!  I love trying them out!</description>
