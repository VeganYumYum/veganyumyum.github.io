		<description>YUM! I used ground flax seed as my egg replacer, and ended up using vegan sour cream instead of soy yogurt (I had already put all the dry ingredients together without realizing - whoops - no soy yogurt on hand!). These are DELICIOUS, I really can&#039;t praise you any more - I had two for breakfast and my (omni) dad loves them too. Thanks so much!</description>

		<description>Oh my gosh these are soooo good!  I like muffins for breakfast and was stressing out over the weekend since I&#039;d decided to be a vegetarian and couldn&#039;t use my normal recipes.  VeganYumYum to the rescue!</description>

		<description>These muffins are SO GOOD !! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used flax (1 Tsp ground flax seed in 3 Tsp of water) instead of Â«Ener-g Egg ReplacerÂ» and it worked well.</description>

		<description>I made them today for breakfast. Delicious! I substitute half of the flour with whole wheet flour, and I only had kid&#039;s fruit yogurt, so I used 4 banana&#039;s and one strawberry cups (50g each). I love them! This exactly want I wanted to make! Thank you very much.</description>
