		<description>This is great! I have never used fresh produce before. Always frozen, but am getting in to eating healthy. This has helped me tremendously.
Thanks.</description>

		<description>Waste. If you slice the whole pepper in half first, then with the tip of the knife you can carve out the seeds and the white membranes inside and you don&#039;t waste any of it. They get expensive.</description>

		<description>One of my favorite methods (that I learned from a culinary student friend) is cutting off the top and bottom first, like you might do with an onion.  Then, keeping the pepper on it&#039;s side, insert the knife horizontally through the middle, with only the pepper between the knife and the cutting board.

Cut through the first rib close to the flesh, (cutting away from your off hand) and roll the pepper like a barrel.  Cut the second rib, roll, cut, roll, cut.. until the entire center is loose, seeds and all.

Pop it out and that leaves you with just the flesh, in a form that&#039;s ready for any cut or dice you desire.  With a little practice the rolling &amp; cutting goes really quick.</description>
