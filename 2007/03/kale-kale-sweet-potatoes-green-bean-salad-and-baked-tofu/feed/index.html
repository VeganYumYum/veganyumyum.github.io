		<description>Such a wonderful looking and colorful meal. It all looks good to me. DH does not like kale, but that does not stop me from eating it all by myself. Love it!</description>

		<description>Everything looks great! I am debating on making your kale soup or some mashed potatoes with sweet potatoes and kale.. maybe I&#039;ll make them both.</description>

		<description>Welcome back VeganYumYum! That looks like a super tasty meal... Kale and sweet potatoes look fantastic to me... but my bf is not a friend of either kale OR sweet potatoes! I&#039;ll have to wait for him to be away for the night sometime... that&#039;s usually when I eat as many sweet potatoes as possible!</description>

		<description>That green bean salad looks lovely. I&#039;ll make sure to make it sometime soon. My man doesn&#039;t like neither greens beans nor nuts so I&#039;ll probably be munching away on my own. The tofu looks really tempting too.</description>
