It&#039;s so cool that they seemed so excited about making you something yummy and hearty AND vegan. That&#039;s neat.

		<description>I have found that asking for vegan dishes produces some of the most delightful results.  I think that maybe the chefs of the world appreciate the challenge :)</description>
