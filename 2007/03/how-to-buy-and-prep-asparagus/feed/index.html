		<description>Thank you! I love asparagus, but have never had any luck when it came time to cook it myself. I knew it was easy, but wow! Thanks for recipe.

		<description>Jody - Asparagus is the cutest name for a cat, ever.  I&#039;m definitely going to try the pasta tip.  I hope it woks!     

Jill - Thank you so much!  I hope you get the most out of asparagus season!

Amey - I&#039;ve heard of cats liking asparagus, but my kitties don&#039;t seem to want any.  Our older cat Dory will eat anything with earth balance in it, so I guess she takes after me!  Also, Yummers ties for the cutest kitty name.  SO CUTE.

Amanda - Thanks!  I can&#039;t remember where I learned that tip, but it has served me well.  They&#039;ll turn into flowers if you let them grow anyway, so why not treat them like flowers!

Vincent - I know, asparagus is SO versatile!  It&#039;s great with many cuisines and many different preparations.  I should try asparagus soup!  

Tiffany - I was running around the house looking for objects to compare asparagus to, so I&#039;m glad you found it useful (and not crazy.  hehe).

Jess - Yay for equal opportunity asparagus love!  I can&#039;t wait to see what you do with yours this season!

Mikaela - Thank you!

Kate - No problem!  I need to make grilled asparagus ASAP!  So good!

Marleigh - That&#039;s so bizarre!  I wonder if it&#039;ll happen again, you must let me know if it does!  :)</description>

		<description>You have some sort of strange psychic link to me. Last week I had broccoli and a bell pepper to use andâ€”magicallyâ€”you posted your soup recipe.

This week, I was planning on eating the asparagus in my fridge alongside some polenta and mushrooms, so I was thinking &quot;Maybe a little balsamic vinegar would go nicely on the asparagus!&quot;

Where did you hide the camera?!</description>
