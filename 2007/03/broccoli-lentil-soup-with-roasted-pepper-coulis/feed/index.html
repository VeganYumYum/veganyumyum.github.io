		<description>My boyfriend discovered this recipe and your blog when hunting for something new.  This recipe was awesome.  I eat a mostly vegetarian diet and he is moving this way rapidly.  Dishes like this one make us both converts -- the awesome flavors and hearty soup served with bread -- excellent.  I used some chipotle pepper and just a pinch of the chilli powder.  We are going to try some tofu recipes next.  Thanks!</description>
