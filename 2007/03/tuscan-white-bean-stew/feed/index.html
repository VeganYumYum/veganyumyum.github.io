		<description>The beauty of the Internet is that you don&#039;t have to ask.  Google added her site to their search results, right?  I have a sneaking suspicion they didn&#039;t ask for her permission. The Internet is a public forum. You don&#039;t have to ask permission to say, &quot;Hey, look what I found over there!&quot;</description>

		<description>Just wanted to let you know that I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I was at the grocery store wondering about dinner, so I pulled out my iPhone, fired up the VYY app, and found this gem.  I love the app with the shopping list right there!  I did leave out the seitan, and subbed spinach for kale &#039;cause we don&#039;t have that at my grocery store, but otherwise I did things as directed.  I can&#039;t wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! =)</description>

		<description>My husband and I love this recipe. We increased the tomato paste a bit and used cannellini beans. We also used homemade spicy seitan. It&#039;s really good over brown rice!</description>
