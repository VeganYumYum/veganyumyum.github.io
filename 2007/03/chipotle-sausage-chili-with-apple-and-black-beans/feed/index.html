		<description>We made this last night for dinner using the TJ&#039;s soyrizo. Despite freezing before slicing and attempting to brown the sausage to solidify it before giving everything a stir, it crumbled during cooking and blended in with the TVP. Whatever! Still tasted amazing!</description>

		<description>hey, roughly how much does the diced sausage yield, in cups? i can&#039;t get anything fancy like that in aylesbury, so i&#039;m using lachesis&#039;s seitan as a sub; how much do i need?
cheers - i can&#039;t wait to make this. it looks divine.

		<description>Wow, I&#039;m can&#039;t say how much I enjoyed this recipe.  I used Italian Flavor Tofurky Sausage and diced chipotle pepper.  I also substituted bulger for TSP.  Thanks for sharing this with us.</description>

		<description>We really like the grain meat sausages &amp; Celebration Roast they make. They seem to be a little on the salty side but have a nice flavor. A Celebration Roast thinly sliced for sandwiches will last quite awhile. And the apple-sage variety is pretty yummy, in my opinion.</description>

		<description>Hi Lolo
I really enjoy your blog and this chili looks great.  I&#039;ll try it soon (especially since it snowed here all day yesterday--yuck--on April 2nd).  However, I&#039;d love to know where you got the fabulous looking green and white bowl that the chili is in....love it. It looks like a coffee mug I&#039;ve been trying to track down that I saw in VegTimes.  Thanks!!

		<description>That looks delicious!  I really like the garnish and the apple.  Sometimes I&#039;ll put pear in my chili.</description>
