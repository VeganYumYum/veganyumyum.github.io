		<description>How do you make the filling?  I imagine you cook it down with all of the ingredients?  Or do you just thaw the fruit, combine and voila?</description>

		<description>Ahhh, gimme one of those - now!  They look fantastic! 
What a great idea with hand pies, I&#039;ll definetely use some of my blueberries on this recipe. They remind me of a brazilian pastel! (deep fried pastry filled with whatever)</description>

		<description>These look amazing!
I tried it out and it was pretty much a failure the first time. I had the same problem of the blueberries leaking out! But I was determined! Next time I just made the dough thicker and it worked great and tasted amazing! I added a little glaze to mine to give it a little kick :)!

Thanks again for the amazing recipe!</description>
