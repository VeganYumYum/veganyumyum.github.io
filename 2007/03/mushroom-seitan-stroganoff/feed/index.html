		<description>How much would this suffer if you left our mushrooms? If the flavor is important could you sub canned mushroom soup or something?</description>

		<description>Excellent recipe!  Although my partner and I have always been real &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; guys, we&#039;ve decided to become vegan.  This is the first vegan recipe I&#039;ve tried and I have to give it a MAJOR TWO THUMBS UP!!!!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  I know I&#039;ll make it again and again.</description>

		<description>Great &quot;Stroganoff&quot;!! I have tried making other vegetarian versions of this before and none quite came out tasting awesome. THIS recipe however is totally delish! My boyfriend who is not a veggie came home and saw me cooking it and was like EW - what is that stuff? &quot;Seitan babe! You&#039;re gonna like it.&quot; He LOVED the whole recipe. He even packed leftovers for lunch today. A definite hit. Thanks for the great recipe!!</description>

		<description>I made this tonight and it was delicious.  Did not use seitan as boyfriend is gluten intolerant and added one extra garlic clove and white pepper and crushed red pepper.  Made it with smoking loon chardonnay and twice as many mushrooms to make up for no seitan.  Really great for you gluten intolerant types.  Thanks so much!~</description>

		<description>I made this recipe tonight, I added shiitake &amp; portabello mushrooms, the seitan is homemade and I added soygurt instead of the sour cream, no wine and it is truly a feast to the palate!
Serving it over ww fettuccine, with steamed broccoli, cucumber salad with a olive oil/white balsamic vinegar dressing.</description>

		<description>This looks great! I have tried seitan stroganoff before and while good, I needed to find something else. I like that this has few ingredients (my grandmother always told me the less ingredients, the better it will likely taste. I found this to be true on more than one occasion) .

Also, I am not sure where you live, but my local Whole Foods and also Wild Oats (which got bought out by Whole Foods, boo!) carry the blue box seitan. It runs about $2.50 still.</description>
