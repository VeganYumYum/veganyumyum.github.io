		<description>Oh man, sorry you hurt yourself!  Is Neosporin vegan?  Keep that area disinfected and how, and wrap it up tight!  

It&#039;s so cool that you canned stuff!  I&#039;ve wanted to do it for ages.  Never without a jar lifter.  Point made.</description>

		<description>Oh I&#039;m so sorry about your hand! Last year my mom and I were trying to can pickles, and we didn&#039;t have a jar lifter, so she just decided that using a spatula would work! Seriously, a spatula, we had to try to scoop it up from the bottom, then grab it with your other hand (1 hand had an oven mit, the other didn&#039;t). Thank god we got a jar lifter this year.</description>

		<description>You poor thing!  I hope you heal up soon.

Mango chutney is one of my favourite condiments -- it goes with everything as far as I&#039;m concerned!</description>

		<description>OH no!!
I&#039;m so sorry to read about your hand. I promise that I will go buy a jar lifter. I do a fair amount of canning, and I&#039;ve always scrapped it with tongs. It looks so scary.

On the other hand, your mango chutney looks beautiful. I&#039;m sure that it will be a bit hit. I wish I could come to the potluck.</description>

		<description>We joined Redfire Farm, since the pick up is just a few minutes from us at the Harvest Coop in JP.  We got 1 share and a fruit share.  It&#039;s a lot of money up front, but we adore CSAs and fresh picked organic goodies, so we think it&#039;s worth it!

Plus, the same amount of food bought from the store would cost more and not be as fresh.  I can&#039;t wait until June, especially because kale is one of the first things to come in season.  Yay kale!</description>

		<description>Oooh, which CSA did you join?  I want to do it, but I&#039;m clueless about the CSAs around here.</description>
