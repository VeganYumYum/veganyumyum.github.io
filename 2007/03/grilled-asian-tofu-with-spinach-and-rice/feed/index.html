		<description>Sandy - Yeah.  You were supposed to have dinner when you got home!

Melody - I can tell I&#039;m going to love mine for years.  I never thought about not being able to use meat marinade (probably because the last time I ate meat I was too young to cook it!), but that&#039;s a good point!

Bazu - Thank you!  It&#039;s amazing what a few grill marks can do!

Sheree - Thanks!  I was so excited to receive something that I actually wanted and will use for years.  I can only hope to give others gifts as thoughtful as this one!  You should buy VwaV!  It&#039;s definitely my most used cookbook!</description>

		<description>Happy Birthday! You have a very thoughtful family. It is so nice to receive gifts that are wanted and useful. Your meal looks wonderful. I will have to check out the recipe. I don&#039;t own the book, but I keep rechecking it out from the library. I have it right now! yeepee</description>

		<description>Looks great! I adore my cast iron skillet and grill pan. I actually was given a very expensive nonstick grillpan and returned it after the first use. It does compare t my $16 cast iron pan. The best money ever spent in my opnion. 

Food looks great as usual. The marinade tip is one I use all the time.. or I freeze it for further use or to add flavor.. oh, the beauty of not using flesh in your meals.. you can eat the marinade without worrying!</description>
