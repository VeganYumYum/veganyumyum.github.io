		<description>so when making / soaking them for overnight, can I put the pot in the fridge?  Or does it remain out overnight?</description>

		<description>I read about steel-cut oats on another food blog, Pinch My Salt, and then wound up here after rooting through the interwebz trying to figure out the best way to make some oatmeal outta them. 

So, cheers, I am so in love with this recipe! I made it last weekend. Forget Quaker Instant Oatmeal packets. Real food is delicious and rewarding.

I made another batch of oatmeal today so I&#039;d have something to bring to work for lunch. Since my mum brought back some ground vanilla beans from her cruise, I added some of that along with almond extract, slivered almonds, and dried cranberries to the oatmeal. I am somewhat in love.</description>

		<description>I make steel cut oatmeal in my rice cooker. Some sophisticated rice cookers have a special setting for this but mine is just a simple one. Before bedtime I put 1/4 cup of steel-cut oats and some cinnamon in the rice cooker along with a cup or a cup and a quarter of water. Turn on the rice cooker and soon a delicious cinnamon smell wafts through the house. When the water has evaporated, the cooker automatically goes to the &quot;warm&quot; setting where I find it in the morning. I then add a cup of yogurt and have a great breakfast. I like the idea of apple, however, and am going to put some applesauce in the mixture and see how that works.</description>

		<description>I used to eat protein shakes for breakfast but have switch to oats which is so much cheaper &amp; satisfying.

Ya, soaking the oats overnight actually make it so much tastier.

I actually eat my oats with sesame oil and japanese soy sauce</description>
