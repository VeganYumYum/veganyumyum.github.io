		<description>&quot;itâ€™s a shame that everyone is assuming this is a difference in creative vision and may not be chalked up to a disagreement over money or some other aspect of publishing.
sucks that you have to find a new publisher, but i feel bad for herbivore, who are now in the position of having put a lot of effort and money into a project that will not materializeâ€¦&quot;

Does the internet really always have to be about people making negative, snarky comments? Lolo already said she doesn&#039;t want people playing the blame game, so why go there? Who cares what the split was about, since it&#039;s no one else&#039;s business anyway?

It sucks for her, it sucks for Josh, as they were both putting a lot of time and money into a project that won&#039;t materialize to their mutual satisfaction. They&#039;re adults and it is possible for people to have an amicable split and we don&#039;t have to choose to like one or the other. This isn&#039;t the third grade playground.</description>

		<description>Awww...I&#039;m so sorry. It really sucks that it won&#039;t be out in time for the holidays. I&#039;ve been waiting for the book for awhile, it doesn&#039;t make much difference if I have to wait longer, I&#039;ll still buy it. I was really looking forward to having it for Christmas! Good luck finding another publisher that works  for you!</description>

		<description>Sorry to here this Lolo!  I look forward to when it is available whether you find a different publisher or even offer a downloadable PDF.

If you weren&#039;t happy, it is better that you didn&#039;t compromise...no matter what the reason.

Pumpkin whoopie pies look great.  When I was a non vegan working at a bakery in Maine, we used to make whoopie pies.

The cake part was just devil&#039;s food cake batter scooped with an ice cream spoon.  IDK if that helps in figuring out the consistency in the future.</description>

		<description>Aw, that&#039;s too bad Lolo! I hope everything works out the way you had planned, in the long run. It&#039;s better to wait and have things done the way you wanted, rather than rush in along. Good move.</description>

		<description>Maybe you could just put it on your blog and charge people for pdfs?  Better than making $1 or $2 per book like most writers.</description>
