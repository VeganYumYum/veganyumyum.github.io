		<description>I have always eaten them boiled with a bit of butter, sugar. pepper and salt and usually from a can.  It occurred to me to try them differently so I sauted an onion and browned ground beef, then I added a can of begas that had been drained and sugar dumped  in the can to take away the bitter.  After those cooked awhile, I added a package of shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix) and let it steam.   WOW ! was it good.  Now I am searching recipes for my fresh bega and going to make some type of cassarole similar for the leftover begas.  Oh... at the things that you can do with this veggie that is a mystery to most of us.  Thanks for the  info on why.</description>

it&#039;s maybe cuter to say in type than in real life. in fact i&#039;m 100% sure of it.</description>
