		<description>First of all, your website&#039;s great- it really takes the sometimes creepy factor out of vegan cooking. I thought this chocolate chip cookie recipe might be helpful- I just tried it, and my cookies turned out amazing! I took a regular chocolate chip recipe and vegan-ed it up. 

2 1/3 c. flour
3/4 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. earth balance
1 c. light brown sugar
1/2 c. sugar
1 egg (egg replacement)
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 c. &quot;chocolate&quot; chips
Mix flour, bkg soda, salt
Cream butter, sugars. Beat in &quot;egg&quot; and vanilla
At a low speed, add flour. Stir in chips.
Bake 12-14 minutes

Hope you like it!
Preheat 375.</description>

		<description>I use the nestle tollhouse recipe and sub one flax egg per egg called for.  I also use an oat/barley flour mix because my son is wheat allergic.  &quot;Normal&quot; people didn&#039;t know the cookies weren&#039;t normal.  They don&#039;t taste much like tollhouse, but they are delicious.</description>

		<description>I just posted a recipe for vegan chocolate chip cookies everyone loves and are really easy to boot - but you have to be ok with banana as an egg replacer.

http://wwaln.blogspot.com/2008/01/chocolate-chip-oatmeal-banana-cookies.html

And no pictures because it was after the sun goes down... at 4:30.  Winter : (

I love your blog!!</description>

		<description>too bad about the cookies, but i look forward to your next cookie post.  you&#039;re so good at explaining things clearly and methodically, and i have so many cookie questions!  such as, once you scoop out your perfect little dough balls with your metal scooper, how much do you flatten the cookies?  or, when should you use parchment paper vs. a silicone mat vs. a plain ungreased cookie sheet?  basically, i guess i&#039;m saying that i&#039;d love to see s setp-by-step cookie tutorial from you!</description>

		<description>SaraJane - I got it at a local kitchen store.  It holds 2 tablespoons and it&#039;s perfect for cookie dough and cupcake batter!</description>

		<description>Hey - where did you get that awesome metal cookie scoop?  I had a plastic one, but it broke about a week ago and I&#039;ve been looking everywhere for another one.  I want to get a metal one this time so it doesn&#039;t break again, but I haven&#039;t had any luck even finding plastic ones again.</description>
