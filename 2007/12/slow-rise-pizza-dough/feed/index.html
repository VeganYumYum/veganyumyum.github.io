		<description>[...] Slow Rise Pizza Dough: There are a few things you need to know about this pizza dough: it needs to be prepared a day in advance, it makes enough for 6 pizza crusts, it preforms best on a pizza stone, and it’s not hard if you follow the directions carefully. The dough does a slow rise/ferment overnight which gives it not only a lovely flavor, but an unbeatable texture. It’s a process you just can’t rush. The good news is that you end up making enough dough for six pizzas, and it can be frozen easily. Recipe from VeganYumYum. [...]</description>

		<description>I lauren 

I made the recipe for pizza dough yesterday. 
Today I ate a pizza with the ball put in refrigerator overnight. 

A delicious pizza dough as I like, really sublime! 
I already made pizza dough, but they are often very thick, very good but different from yours! 
There was perfect! 
I am also very happy because I still have 5 balls of pasta in the freezer! 

Thank you for this recipe, I knew it was going to be successful! Vegan yumyum is very talented!</description>

		<description>It seems to me that most of the benefit of parchment paper is that you can skip the pizza peel + cornmeal step!

Just pick up the parchment paper and place it directly on the stone. If you must, you can slide the peel under the parchment paper and transfer it on to the stone with a gentle slide of the wrist. The parchment paper will not burn at 450 degrees. In fact, if you bake often, you can save the parchment and use it for your next pizza or flatbread.

By the way, I love the photography on your blog. Any tips, besides shooting in daylight?</description>

		<description>I, too, came across Peter Reinhardt&#039;s recipe on Heidi&#039;s website. I , too, was converted. I too bought the his book, and I agree with you, it is kick ass! Do you like the whole grains book? Is it worth the investment? If anything, the only complaint I have about his apprentice book is that he doesn&#039;t include a lot of recipes with whole grains, although at least he does talk about how to use them in a breads and so on. I usually just make up my own bread recipes following the general science rules of breadmaking anyway. Your pizza looks delicious! I love cheese, but I don&#039;t usually slather it on, its an ingredient equal but not more important than the others. Caramelized onion and olives really make my day on a pizza.</description>

		<description>I never though I could ever make a pizza that could taste this good. Also note that &#039;topping the pizza mosdestly&#039; is not imperative; I kept stacking and stacking the vegetables and it still came out super!
Thanks for sharing the recipe.</description>

		<description>I made this one today and it rocked our world!
I made two pizza&#039;s, one on a baking sheet, one on a baking rack.
The rackpizza was kinda deeppan and moist, the other one crispy. They both tasted super!
Thanx for the recipe!</description>

		<description>Avocado slices have become the cheese on pizza for me.  If you slice them onto the  pie just as it comes out of the oven, they warm up without cooking (which makes them a little bitter) and taste just great as a stand-in for cheese!  

I also will make a pine-nut crumble in the food processor with pine nuts, nutri yeast, salt and garlic in leiu of cheese.</description>
