		<description>I&#039;ve been searching the net for a vegan roast beef recipe with no luck. I have a lovely sirloin tip ready to pop in the oven. Any Ideas?</description>

		<description>I just walked out of my kitchen and I think I&#039;ve got the solution (if you don&#039;t mind having deep fried sweet potato fries).

I used an older sweet potato, and cut between a julienne and a battonette cut (what some establishments would call a &quot;skinny fry&quot;).
Place on a bake sheet covered with parchment paper and baked at 400F for under 5 minutes (just until they were flimsy).
I allowed them to cool and then deep fried until cooking was complete.

They came out CRISPY!!!</description>

		<description>Great recipe. I doubled up on the spices since I live spicy food. Just came across your blog. This recipe certainly has made a dedicated reader of your blog of me.</description>

		<description>I have heard that by cooking them twice helps to make them crispy.  Give them a quick initial cooking. Let them sit. and them finish them off. I learned this on the Food Network. Cheers, Lolo! Lovey our blog</description>

		<description>All I have to say is... Old bay spice. It&#039;s the key ingredient to sweet potato fries.</description>
