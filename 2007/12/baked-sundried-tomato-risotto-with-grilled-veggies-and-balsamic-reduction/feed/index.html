		<description>We had this for our Christmas feast, 2008... even with fake white wine (de-alcoholized from Trader Joe) it was utter perfection.  I just had to make it again (twice), this time sans garlic and onion due to my sattvic diet (so, I cheated the first time) and it was STILL utter perfection.
When I was a vegetarian and was told my food was &quot;restaurant quality&quot; I was a bit miffed.  Of course.  Why would there be any doubt?
Now that I am eating a vegan diet, I do not take compliments like that for granted.  But folks, this IS beyond restaurant quality!  Thank you Lolo for making our feast memorable!</description>
