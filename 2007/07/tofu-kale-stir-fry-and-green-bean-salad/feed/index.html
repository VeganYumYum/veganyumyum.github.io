		<description>I’ve also learned  that fermenting tofu is a way of preserving tofu which I would like to try due to its more natural preservation of the food ingrediences.</description>

		<description>Yes to frozen tofu! Freeze, Thaw, Squeeze, Slice, Press, Cube, Panko, Fry! I am powerless. I usually toss the cubes with some &#039;Braggs&#039; before the Panko. It seems so labor intensive, but so worth it to me. 
Just found you! Beautiful Pics and great recipes. I am not Vegan, but we eat vegan fairly often, so thanks for all the sharing!
Oh! I also wanted to point out that if you &#039;finish&#039; the fried tofu in the oven, a lot of the oil will move on out, I put my fried tofu on a paper bag on a cookie sheet in a 350 oven.</description>

		<description>That tofu looks absolutely delicious! I used to freeze tofu just because I could never finish it before spoilage, but it never quite turned out as nice as that! And I learned a tofu lesson the hard way: freeze them in single servings so you don&#039;t have to cut through hard chunks of frozen tofu everytime you feel like using some!</description>
