		<description>I just made this tonight, since your recipe was the first that came up on Google and it looked delicious.  I modified a little -- I added leeks and mushrooms, and did a mix of cabbage and collards since they were my have-to-use vegetables this week.  But I never would have thought to do the nutritional yeast and thyme and splash of soy... In my opinion, it made the dish.  Big hit with the non-vegan housemates too.  Great!</description>
