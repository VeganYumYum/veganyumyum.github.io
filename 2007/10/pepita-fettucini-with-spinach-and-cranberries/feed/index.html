		<description>Made this tonight for Valentine&#039;s Day, and it came out wonderfully.  Was extremely simple to make, and had a very unique taste--a pasta dish with a new taste is something remarkable indeed.</description>

		<description>I know this is an old post, but I just wanted to drop in to say how much I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for myself last year shortly after you posted it, and a few weeks later for a potluck (using spiral noodles instead of fettucini).  I&#039;m making it for another potluck this Sunday, and I am SO excited to be bringing it.  Even though your recipe calls for serving immediately, I found it held up really well on a buffet.

Thank you!!</description>

		<description>Found this digging around in the archive, looking for something ELSE to do with the chard abundance in the garden- so...substituted chard for spinach- kept everything else- a HUGE success with the fam&#039;. Also the first time there hasnt been a dish with onions/garlic etc on the table!
Thanks</description>

		<description>Hello,

Just popping by to say we tried this and it was gorgeous. Loved the sweetness and it was a nice change to have the spinach cooked in a little oil rather than in a watery way.  I made one little swop - sour cherries instead of cranberries</description>

		<description>This looks great! 

I&#039;m a big fan of experimental pasta, but combining maple syrup and tamari never occurred to me.</description>
