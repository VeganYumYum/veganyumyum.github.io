		<description>I LOVE THIS SOUP! Make it ALL THE TIME! I pan fry the tofu (A whole block pressed and cubed small) in some Braggs and pepper... I probably double the carrots and onions... Used tomato sauce so I don&#039;t have to bother with the blending... I don&#039;t know where you went lady but this soup will always have a special place in my little vegan heart &lt;3</description>

		<description>What a delicious, easy-to-make soup!  I baked my own tofu while the onions were frying and I was preparing and assembling the other ingredients.  And the soup was even better the next day-- so comforting and warming!</description>

		<description>This recipe is a keeper. Made it this weekend. Tasted great hot off the stove, but also tastes really good cold. I keep going to the fridge for big spoonfuls. 

I added chopped celery and minced garlic to mine. Also, I forgot to get the marinated tofu that I wanted to use, so I used the seitan that I had on hand, and chopped it up into little pieces. Not bad, but I&#039;m sure the tofu would have been perfect.

I like the very low amount of oil used. The lack of lots of oil makes the soup taste light and healthy.</description>
