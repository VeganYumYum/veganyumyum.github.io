		<description>My family is from maine, the home of the whoopie pie! I have a family recipe that&#039;s been passed down from generation to generation, and while it&#039;s not vegan I might be able to give you a tip!

One big key to making the pie part of the Whoopie Pie is adding soured milk (milk with some vinegar added to it). It helps to give the pie it&#039;s unique texture, unless you&#039;re making Pennsylvania style whoopie pies, in which case I&#039;m not sure! The batter for the pie shouldn&#039;t be similar to cookie dough...it should be a thick liquid. You shouldn&#039;t be able to form balls with it with your hands, but if you put a spoon full on a baking sheet, it shouldn&#039;t run a lot. 

For the filling, the Maine version uses a really light and fluffy combination of eggs, confectioners sugar, shortening and vanilla. Again, I realize this isn&#039;t Vegan, but it might help you out!!</description>
