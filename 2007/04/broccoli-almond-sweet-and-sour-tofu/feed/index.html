		<description>[...] This recipe from Vegan Yum Yum caused me a bit of grief. I guess I&#8217;ll start by saying it tasted great and the sauce had the fabulous gooey consistency of Chinese take-out, so that was good. However, I had a lot of problems with the tofu. It requires tossing the cut pieces in Ener-G egg replacer and water, and then cornstarch to give a nice coating before frying them. While I did this I became well on my way to making a nice tofu paste. I&#8217;m guessing I didn&#8217;t press my tofu enough and there was still too much moisture to make this work correctly. Next time I will definitely make more of an effort (this little kitchen gadget looks fabulous for this purpose, btw&#8211;it will be on my Christmas list). I also placed the tofu in a bowl and attempted to coat it by stirring; this was not a good plan. I should have gone the shake-in-a-bag (or tupper) route, I think this would have worked much better. Then, since my coating wasn&#8217;t very uniform, and in many parts non-existent, the tofu didn&#8217;t fry up very well and I had a big mess in my wok. [...]</description>

		<description>Wow - I just came across your blog and you have truly inspired me.  I am not much of a cook at all (my husband is a FANTASTIC one and a carnivore deluxe to boot) and I thought I would give this recipe a try.  It turned out great, we both loved it.  Thank you for posting it and thank you for giving me the motivation to try something in the kitchen!  I am going to see what else I can do now...</description>
