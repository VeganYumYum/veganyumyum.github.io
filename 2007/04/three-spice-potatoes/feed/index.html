		<description>Tamarind Lentils?!?! Do you have a recipe for those?? I will try some google-fu later, but man that sounds delish (and I, too, need to eat more lentils).

&lt;em&gt;Hi Molly!  It&#039;s a recipe from the book Veganomicon!  Great recipe, and the book is worth it, if you don&#039;t already own it. :)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

		<description>hi,
lovely site.

here is a 3-spice 1-lentil potato recipe from south india which is really yummy. the three spices are black mustard seeds, turmeric and red chili powder. urad dal (white) is the lentil and cannot be substituted with anything else mainly due to the aroma the combination produces.

heat oil, then when the mustard seeds pop, add the urad dal (1-2 tsp) and when they brown, add potatoes. I usually boil them ahead but if you chop the potatoes into finer cubes you dont have to. my preference is to cut each medium sized potato into 4 or 5 pieces. once the potatoes brown, you can add turmeric and chili powder and salt it.</description>

		<description>Thank you so much, everyone!

Michelle - as long as your pans have heat-proof handles, they should be able to go into the oven.  Watch out for anything wood or plastic!  If it&#039;s wood, you can wrap the handle in a wet washcloth and then over that in tin foil to protect it!</description>
