		<description>Okay I made this for dinner and it was AMAZING. I think i am now addicted to this peanut sauce.

For those asking about the mirin. I had the same dilemma, so I googled it. You can substitute white wine with a bit of sugar added. (I had brown sugar on hand). http://seattletimes.com/html/foodwine/2009252736_zfoo27qanda.html 

I also added snow peas because I&#039;m a veggie-aholic.</description>

		<description>I love to use coconut milk in cooking but I never need a whole can. Do you think if I stirred it up and then poured the extras into ice cube trays that I could freeze it and then put it in baggies for future recipes? 

I know it might separate a bit while freezing, but if you stir right before you pour into trays, it will all mix back together when it melts in the pan.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m making this now- just popped over to the chinese market and got mirin but also instead of pan frying the tofu, I just bought fried tofu which looks like will work perfectly too.

Lauren, you rock.  I look at your book every other day for inspiration.  I&#039;ve been vegan for a while and your creativity is wonderful.  xo</description>

		<description>I am eating this right now and LOVING IT.  Thought I might switch from snow peas to broccoli (I used the book version), but I think I&#039;m sold.  This dish makes me feel clever and accomplished!</description>

		<description>This was a wonderful and delicious dish. So easy to make as well. GIYF, cause I just plugged in tofu and mirin and you popped up! My family found this deeply satisfying and it was a refreshing dish to make on a hot day. So easy too. I will admit that we cheated and added chicken breast that I treated the same way as the tofu. I stuck with the tofu, though and didn&#039;t miss the meat. My father thought the dish contained chicken, beef and pork, so he was happy. My mother loved it and said to be sure to save the recipe. I used chunky peanut butter and put toasted sesame seeds on top.

Tip: make the dressing in a jar, then just shake shake to combine. The leftover dressing will be great on noodles.</description>
