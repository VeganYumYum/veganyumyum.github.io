		<description>Kale hummus is one of my favorites! Although I&#039;ve never tried steaming the kale before throwing it in the food processor - I usually just throw it in raw.</description>

		<description>I make hummus quite frequently &amp; thought I&#039;d give this a try last night.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it.  I never would have thought of putting kale in.</description>

		<description>I made way too much hummus with this recipe - and it&#039;s delicious!  but I wanted to share with you that I had the idea of combining this recipe with isa&#039;s chickpea cutlet recipe, making a kale/sundried tomato chickpea cutlet that&#039;s (if possible) even better than the original cutlet.  I also made the cutlets half the size called for, and baked them - these are crispy, tasty goodness!</description>

		<description>Tried this over the weekend and really loved it!  What a great way to sneak in more kale.  I also added some lemon juice and cumin with good results.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  I linked to it on my blog as well.</description>
