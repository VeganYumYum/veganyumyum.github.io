		<description>Who is cooking with Lavender?  You may want to research what Lavender oils can do for boys (maybe men).  Google: Lavender and Tea Tree Oils May Cause Breast Growth in Boys ...  So throw out that shampoo if you have men in the house.  Not sure about cooking and eating it though...  But I wouldn&#039;t personally.</description>

		<description>Oh I forgot to add, fatty foods such as sour supreme and avocados, will hasten the omg spiciness out of your mouth,  I&#039;ve also been experimenting rubbing my fingers on stainless steel, like with garlic.  I think it helps but it is difficult to say since I&#039;m not brave enough to test my fingers out on my mouth or eyes after wards.</description>

		<description>The amount of heat in a pepper (membranes aside) depends greatly on two factors.  The first is obvious, the type of pepper.  The second factor has to do with the climate the pepper is grown in.  The hotter the climate the hotter the peppers with be.  For example I lived in Arizona and was advised to buy milder seeds than someone who lived in say Colorado.  This was because if I bought the same seeds as someone in Oregon the ones I planted would turn out spicier because of Arizona&#039;s hot climate.  Weird, huh?   I got that advice from cherrygal.com  Not sure it helps though, unless you live somewhere colder and buy ones that were locally grown.</description>

		<description>I was just checking out the contents of your book, which I ordered. I remember testing the &quot;bean cheeze&quot; and making these poppers when you were still in the testing stages. The recipe didn&#039;t make it into the book, so I was hoping you&#039;d post the recipe for the original &quot;bean cheeze.&quot; it was so good, I could have eaten it all with a spoon before they even made it into the peppers!!!! I know this original post was a long time ago, so I&quot;m hoping you see it and respond! Thanks!</description>

		<description>I love poppers.  I&#039;ll repeat what others have said: you have to get ALL the seeds out.  In fact, you can make a milder crushed dried red pepper if you shake the seeds out (older folks, use an album cover and pretend you&#039;re back in the &#039;70s cleaning your, ummm...).  But the real trick to poppers is roasting the peppers in the oven until the skin toasts and splits and then you rub the skin off with a paper towel, piece of newspaper, brown paper bag, whatever.

I was led here looking for cheese substitutes for those with impaired kidney function.  There are an awful lot of people who have that and they have to limit minerals--sodium, potassium and phosphorus.  Yeast, nuts, dried beans?  High in phosphorus.  They can always take a phosphorus binder but that&#039;s another pill.  Well, it&#039;s just a spare time thing when I think of it.  Vegan is a choice; kidney failure isn&#039;t.  A vegan with kidney failure?  Wow...that would be rough.

Thanks for the ideas, though.</description>

		<description>There&#039;s enormous variation in heat for any pepper variety.  I&#039;ve had Habaneros that weren&#039;t that bad, and Jalapenos that were killers.  There&#039;s only one reliable solution, and that&#039;s to taste a bit of the pepper before you use it.  Peppers from the same batch will probably have similar heat levels.  Removing the seeds and membranes will help, but you need to check the heat before you use them so you know what you&#039;re getting, and how much to use (for recipes where the chili is an ingredient rather than the focus).</description>

		<description>Pickling chilli&#039;s leeches out a lot of the heat and often even makes them a little bit sweet.  Very suited for this recipe!

You could try blanching or lightly boiling the jalepeno&#039;s before you stuff, batter and fry them, this makes them a little softer after frying and can take out some heat.

Also if heat really is a continuing issue and you haven&#039;t tried a cheese-stuffing, try that, as cheese and dairy products help your mouth and throat cope a lot more with the heat.

Sugar or something sweet, maybe strong cordial, is very good for if you accidentally get a bite that&#039;s too firey and need to put the flames out!</description>

		<description>If you can&#039;t stand the heat, stay out of the jalapenos!</description>
