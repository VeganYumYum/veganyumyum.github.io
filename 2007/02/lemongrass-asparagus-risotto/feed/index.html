		<description>You made the continuous risotto look so good I could hold out no longer and made some a couple of times (basic mushroom and pea, then mushroom and asparagus).  One way to painlessly shave off stir time: pressure cook the monster for 5 minutes.  If you stir in and burn off the alcohol from the wine, then add 4 cups of stock before sealing it up, you&#039;re left in the end with about 5-6 minutes of stirring before it&#039;s tender but firm and good to go.  

Thanks for all the great stuff and the inspiration -- Ilene</description>

		<description>Here goes:

Tom Yummm! Thai-Inspired Soup (from Carb Conscious Vegetarian, Robin Robertson)

5 c veggie stock
1 piece (4&quot;) lemongrass, crushed
1 slice (1/4&quot;) fresh ginger, peeled
Grated peel and juice of 1 lime
1 tsp asian chili paste or to taste  ****I put more like 1-2tbsp in
1 c oyster mushrooms, quartered if large
16 pencil thin asparagus spears, cut diagonally into 1&quot; pieces
3 shallots, cut lengthwise into thin slivers
1 tbsp tamari
3 scallions
2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
***1 can coconut milk*** variation by me...not in original recipe

In a large pot, combine the stock, lemongrass, ginger about 1 tsp lime peel and chili paste.  bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 min.  Strain mixture, return broth to saucepan and bring to boil.  Add the mushrooms, asparagus, shallots, tamari and coconut milk.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 3 minutes.  Stir in scallions and 1 tbsp lime juice or more to taste, and simmer until heated through, 1-2 min.  Sprinkle with clilantro to serve.


I think it would be even better with fried tofu in it.  It tasted like a lemongrass &amp; coconut milk soup I miss terribly from Swing Thai (a take out thai place in denver).  The mushrooms were great in it - hadn&#039;t had oyster mushrooms, so it was perfect.  this cookbook is good - I appreciate the soups from these low carb veggie cookbooks the most.

		<description>That sounds so good and the pictures are amazing.  I recommend making soup - I recently made the Tom Yummm! Thai inspired soup from the carb conscious vegetarian, and added coconut milk and it was super delicious.  I The lemongrass is cooked in the stock.  I will post the recipe if you are interested.</description>
