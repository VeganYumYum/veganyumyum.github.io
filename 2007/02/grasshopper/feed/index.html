		<description>I live in the SF bay area, and used to live in Portland OR. If you think San Francisco is good for vegan food (Millennium is my all-time favorite restaurant) you really, really should go to Portland. That place is a vegan mecca. When we go to visit friends, we practically plan our whole visit around the many places to eat.</description>

		<description>Ronald&#039;s donuts taste just like regular donuts! Once I started on my dozen I couldn&#039;t stop! They are so addictive, which is bad because they may be vegan, but they are fried and sugary after all. Still, I urge everyone to try them at least once in their lifetime!</description>

		<description>I live in Brighton, and the first time I went to Grasshoppers I got the tofu chicken nuggets because I&#039;ve never had tofu. My friend got the No-Name and I would not stop picking off of his plate.
No-Name is soooo delicious.</description>

		<description>Did your horror stories about cockroaches include vulnerable women screaming and standing on tables trying not to show their ankles? Or mutants with laser beams? Or were they blood-drinking vampire insects with nocturnal plans of global domination?

Buddha&#039;s delight is closed. And you think there are no cockroaches in Chinatown? HAH

Your face is vegan.</description>

		<description>I hate to say it, but I can&#039;t stand Grasshopper. I&#039;ve eaten there a few times and I just don&#039;t like the atmosphere and general dining crowd there. It&#039;s too &quot;Allston&quot; (I can say that because I live here). I&#039;ve heard  horror stories of cockroaches at Grasshopper. 

I&#039;d really really recommend Buddha&#039;s Delight in Chinatown, if you haven&#039;t been there. Buddha&#039;s Delight sits nicely above Chinatown, has a massive menu, and is generally cheaper than Grasshopper. I believe all of the items are vegan, except for some of the dessert.</description>

		<description>Hi there!  Just stumbled upon your amazing website and wanted to say how much I love it!  I just recently converted to vegetarianism and I&#039;m always in need for new recipes. Please don&#039;t ever take this site down!

Also, I am from Boston and I go to Grasshopper whenever I can.  Sooo yummy.</description>

		<description>Debra - It was such a good and fancy food day, I do admit.  I&#039;m lucky to have had someone offer to bring me donuts without any prompting!  I&#039;m definitely excited to have them again when I visit Las Vegas in the future.  

Thanks for commenting!  I hope you get a donut or grashopper fix soon.  :)</description>

		<description>OMG!! I&#039;M sO JEALouS!! 

So sorry, but my inner brainless teen HAD to come out on this post. I&#039;m so insanely jealous. First, Grasshopper....  no name ??! How excellent is THAT, also... I&#039;ve tried the taro nest, and that is good too. The only thing that would have topped this off for me is if you had the sweet &amp; sour sensation (basically the &quot;no name&quot; with tofu rather than seitan) pictured with a side of chili sauce. 

Next, I had the amazing opportunity of trying Ronald&#039;s donuts while driving cross-country back to San Diego from Boston. My boyfriend and I ordered a dozen (for a mere $8) upon leaving Las Vegas and finished half of the box by the time we were in CA. I now make it mandatory for anyone of my friends who are making the 6-hour trip to Las Vegas for the weekend to return with a box for me! 

So again, super jealous because I have only had the pleasure of enjoying Grasshopper and Ronald&#039;s in the same week, not in the same day!! 

... hey, grasshopper mails well in a box packed with dry ice, right?  ;P</description>

		<description>Everything looks excellent! I&#039;ve often wished I could live in Boston, at least for a few years! (I&#039;m too much of an itinerant to ever stay in one place for too long!) All the dishes seem so artfully presented. Wow.</description>
