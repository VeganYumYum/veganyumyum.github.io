		<description>I love Brussels sprouts! I often cut them in half, coat them in oil and salt and roast till outer leaves are crispy -- my favorite way to eat them! Yum! I also like them steamed, with butter and garlic. I mix the cooked sprouts into beef stew just before it&#039;s eaten, or cold tossed in green salads. I wash the outer leaves well and freeze them to use later in soup stock. Now that I know I can eat them raw, I&#039;ll try that, too. I&#039;m trying to do 51% RAW meals to get proper amount of enzymes. I actually just cooked some sprouts I got at the farmers market -- much better than store bought! Great site!</description>

		<description>My mum used to cut that &#039;X&#039; in the bottom and then cook them until they were mush.  Couldn&#039;t stand the little bastards until I tried cooking them myself.. no X, and just a quick steam, delish!</description>

		<description>mmm...Brussels sprouts.
They are definitely best if picked after a frost though - much sweeter. In fact, the best brussels sprouts I&#039;ve ever had were picked Christmas day during a mild winter (I live in southern Ontario...in Canada...)</description>
