		<description>Thank you for making brussel sprouts yummy! I always hated them when I was a kid. I spaced out when shopping and picked up orange juice instead of apple juice or cider. The orange juice worked great. I&#039;ll try again with the apple to compare.</description>

		<description>my very sweet but definitely not a cook boyfriend made me these sprouts.  unfortunately he&#039;s someone who follows recipes to a T no matter what and the 4 minutes of cooking time were not nearly enough.  the flavors were delicious and i&#039;m excited to try this again with a well cooked sprout.  thanks so much!</description>

		<description>This was an exalent dinner! I&#039;m kind of embarassedto say, this was the first time I have ever cooked with beets. I was under the impression that I didn&#039;tlike them, well I gues I had just never had them cooked properly. They were delicious! Even plain, just diced, before I mixed them with the rice and dressing. They were kind of sweet. And my (and my husband&#039;s) favorite part was the greens. I didn&#039;t have collard so I subed fresh kale and spinach. (I also added some garlic clove and a couple crimini mushrooms, yum!) That turned out just scruptous!! The whole thing was great, thanks for the recipe!!</description>

		<description>Maybe I missed it, but how did you get the heart shapes? Is their such a teeny tiny heart shaped cutter out there? Pray tell.

&lt;em&gt;I used Aspic Cutters.  Good luck!&lt;/em&gt;</description>
