		<description>Alix:  I&#039;ve seen another purple cabbage salad recipe that used toasted sesame seeds, so maybe that would make a good substitute for those with nut allergies.

I&#039;m going to try this recipe with dried cranberries instead of currants (just because I have them). I understood &quot;currants&quot; to be dried red or black currants, which grow in clusters on shrubs. Fresh red currants tend to be more sour than the black ones. Black currants are the flavour known as &quot;cassis&quot; in Europe. I&#039;ve never heard of zante currants, but if the package only lists &quot;currants&quot; as the ingredients, who knows?</description>

		<description>This was *sooo* delicious, the vinaigrette especially! I replaced the currents with dried cranberries and added some thinly shaved Gala apple - yum! :D</description>

		<description>Alix,

I was thinking of replacing the almonds with croutons, or maybe some kind of nut-free granola? Jicama would be very nice but not as much protein.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve only tried redcurrants and i can tell you they taste nothing like raisins, they are super bitter and for many people unedible because of it.
Honestly in my country, Portugal, they mostly sell to make alcoholic drinks and that&#039;s it.</description>

		<description>Does anyone have any suggestions of what I could replace the almonds with? I&#039;m deathly allergic to tree nuts, but I&#039;d want to keep the protein that would be included by using them.

Or at least to keep the texture and add some flavor.</description>
