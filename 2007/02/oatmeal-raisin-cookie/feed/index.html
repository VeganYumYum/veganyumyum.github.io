		<description>Came across this recipe and decided to try it right away.  I made a few substitutions though.  I used 3/4 cup olive oil instead of the vegan marg.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cups reg sugar.  I did use 2 eggs, but substituted white for whole wheat flour and also added in 1/4 cup flaxsead meal.  I also added 1/2 cup choc. chips, 1/2 cup shredded coconut and 1/2 cup walnuts.  I packed my 1/4 cup measuring cup with the mixture and lightly tapped it to get dough out onto cooking sheet (no need for parchment paper) then lightly pressed down to spread a bit.  I baked them for additional 5 min. for 20 min. total at 350 degrees.  Cookies spread a bit into beautiful giant round cookie shapes.  When done, carefully use spatula to lift off cookie sheet and place onto cooking rack.  Enjoy!  Tastes a-w-e-s-o-m-e!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!</description>

		<description>Made these today and only had 3/4 cup margarine. Still made them with 1/4 cup less oats. First batch went in the oven looked really dry. So with the remaining dough, I added applesauce to make it more moist. Baked the second batch.

The results:

First batch came out looking really dry and unappetizing, but after they cooled, they were actually not! They were delicious! The flavor was very buttery and chewy like a non-vegan cookie would be.

The second batch came out looking excellent - they browned around the edges and looked very moist, and they were, but i thought the applesauce was too prominent.  They were definitely more cake-like. 

In the end, I discovered looks are definitely deceiving. Even though something may not look appetizing, they turned out really good and better than expected!</description>

		<description>Made a single batch, and I had the same problem with the cookies spreading out and forming a sticky candy-like crust on the bottom of each cookie.  I added 1/2 cup of flour to the mix and put them on a higher rack in the oven.  I used 5 Tbsp ground flax seed w 6 tbsp water as the egg replacer, and I only used 1 cup of raisins.  8-9 min. in the oven was perfect.

Maybe i used a different egg replacer or amount?</description>
