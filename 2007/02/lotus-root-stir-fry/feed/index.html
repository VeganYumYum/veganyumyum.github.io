		<description>I know i&#039;m 3 years late commenting on this, but just incase someone checks these comments like I just did, I&#039;ll add mine.

I bought some pre-sliced lotus root yesterday for $0.99!  It&#039;s really not expensive.  I can&#039;t wait to try this recipe tonight with spicy shredded tofu (also $0.99!)</description>

		<description>Hi there,
I live in Asia and my mum often cook lotus root soup, which is absolutely delicious. 
I&#039;m so happy to chance upon this recipe because it&#039;s different from the normal vegetable dishes we always cook (those bore me like crazy!)
I&#039;m thinking of cooking this tomorrow but i&#039;m pretty confused about the basil sauce.
What&#039;s Tamari and toasted sesame oil? Do you put the sesame oil in the oven for a while? T_T
Pardon my ignorance, heh. 
Looking forward to your reply!!! 
(And eating this dish)</description>

		<description>Brooke, don&#039;t be scared!  I don&#039;t think you can mess them up!

Stephanie, I can&#039;t remember how much they were, but I bet they&#039;d be cheaper at an asian market (compared to whole foods!).</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve never seen a lotus root before, that&#039;s so cool looking. Are they expensive? And that stir-fry looks totally awesome :)</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been seeing lotus root at WF and never bought them....I was scared!  Now I feel more confident that I can make something that is tasty with them.  :-)</description>
