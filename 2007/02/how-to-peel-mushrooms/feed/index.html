		<description>Exactly!! Why wash them? No amount of washing is going to change the fact that they&#039;ve grown in poop and that they are a FUNGUS. Just eat &#039;em!</description>

		<description>Woodland lore will tell you never to eat wild mushrooms for fear of them being poisonous.  My father will tell you the rule of thumb is, &quot;If you can peel it, you can eat it.&quot;  I&#039;ve not fully explored this theory and would recommend severe caution. 

I, also, always peel my mushrooms.  Several cookbooks will tell you that you shouldn&#039;t, that all the nutrients are in that peel, that all the flavor is in the peel.  I&#039;ve never noticed a taste difference.   

However, I now take a moment to point out that mushrooms are grown in manure.  They are frequently shipped with the manure still sticking to them.  I&#039;m not like most that have an irrational fear of animal feces, but c&#039;mon now, I don&#039;t want to eat it.  And no quick rinse is going to work here. 

I am a mushroom peeling advocate.</description>

		<description>I grew up peeling mushrooms, so am always surprised when others find my peeling mushrooms suprising!  And even after peeling, I give them a quick rinse to catch any left over dirt.  Given the dirt and fertilizers, I have no trouble making it a routine.
I can&#039;t imagine eating them any other way.  It is simply the best way to eat raw mushrooms!  And on some mushrooms, you can easily peel them without removing the stem (although I agree, it is fun to do)!</description>

		<description>Get a sharp knife. Cut the fruit/vegetable into smaller pieces. Cook with (or eat raw) those smaller pieces. Enjoy. (In other words, don&#039;t worry so much about technique; worry about the cooking aspect.)</description>

		<description>Can you share the best way to cut a tomato, a mango, a pineapple, a watermelon, julienne (sp?) veggies, and how the hell to properly use lemongrass? I am a brand new vegan who grew up with a non-cooking mother, so even the simplest things I need help with. I love your cutting  tutorials.....oh, and I went to BU for  undergrad so I know Boston pretty well!
Cheers.</description>

		<description>Why bother peeling or washing mushrooms? Chop them up, throw them in the pan, and get to work.</description>

		<description>I wash my mushrooms super quickly. We eat them so much I think I&#039;d go crazy peeling them. 

As fo the cold water/boiling thing, I always thought you weren&#039;t supposed to use hot water for boiling/drinking because it has more sediment in it.</description>
