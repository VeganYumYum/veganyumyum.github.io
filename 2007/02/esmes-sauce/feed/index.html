		<description>Oh so good -- we add arugula (the spiciness goes so well with the other flavors) and red pepper flakes.  And pretty much lick the pan after we eat it all.</description>

		<description>I love this sauce!!!!!!!!!!!!! I use the nooch, and garlic (I cook the garlic a bit first to neutralize it) and use the rice vinegar instead of lemon. And I almost always put the mirin in. I make this a LOT now. Thanks so much for making this popular :)</description>

		<description>I just tried out this recipe today for dinner, and I really loved it, really easy to cook and rich. Mine sauce turned out to be dark yellow, but I indeed used normal miso instead of sweet white, and because we don&#039;t have nutritional yeast here in brazil, I used mustard. Even so, I really loved it. 
Nikki said it all, it&#039;s a great salad dressing as well.

Thanks for sharing, I&#039;ve been checking out this blog for quite a while, and now I&#039;m a fan!</description>

		<description>I made this sauce tonight to go with a quinoa dish.  It was so wonderful!  It also makes a good salad dressing when cooled.</description>
