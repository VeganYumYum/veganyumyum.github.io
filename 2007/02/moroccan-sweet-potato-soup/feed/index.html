		<description>Hey Stewart, you are awesome!  I totally concur with Claudia.  My husband has never made me soup, but he knows exactly how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I will enjoy completely when I am under the weather.  Bravo to you for a wonderful VeganYumYum contribution and for the sweet care you give Lauren.  I hope she feels better very soon, I send you both warm hugs</description>

		<description>This sounds yummy and very healthy!  And I love how you adapted the recipe to what&#039;s available in the winter months.  

I hope Lauren feels better soon!</description>
