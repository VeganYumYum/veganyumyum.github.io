		<description>If you should ever find yourself in Columbus, OH, you&#039;d love Pattycake Vegan Bakery.  It is to DIE FOR!  There&#039;s also a fancy-shmancy all vegan restaurant called Dragonfly Neo-V.  I here it&#039;s good, but I have yet to go there.</description>

		<description>Next time you&#039;re in DC, you MUST MUST MUST check out Soul Vegetarian Cafe (or, SoulVeg to us locals).  Forget that it&#039;s all vegan, some of the most delicious soul food I&#039;ve ever had.  And, on top of that, a great community establishment with absolutely wonderful staff that draws veggies and non-veggies alike.  Their lasagna is absolutely to die for!

2606 Georgia Ave. NW - Washington, DC 20001

Peace!</description>

		<description>Are you the same Sticky Bun resturant that Paula&#039;s son&#039;s came to visit?  I would like to order some buns for a friend of mine as a thank you gift but want to be sure.

The buns looked delicious and if they are as healthy as they sound, I will get some for myself to.  I have diabetes and have to be careful about what I eat.

Thank you,
Mickey</description>

		<description>I love, love, love the Little Devils and the breakfast veggie egg sandwiches (next time, use the microwave for about a minute to heat up your sandwich--it&#039;ll be much better).  I am very fortunate to live a few blocks from Sticky Fingers, but since they aren&#039;t open late, I really can&#039;t get there much :(</description>
