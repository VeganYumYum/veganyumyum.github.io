		<description>This looks wonderful, Finally some vegan and recipes I can easily find the ingredients for. And some baked goods and dessert recipes that include my favorite friut, the avocado. However I have never seen this tempareature notation before, Âº. Is it a typo? If not what is it in Farenheit?</description>

		<description>I gave these cookies a shot tonight - they turned out great!  For a spin i put a bit of shredded coconut on the top of each cookie.   It added a nice garnish and the toasted coconut tasted great.</description>

		<description>great replacer idea!  

A great goal would be to further refine the recipe so that manufactured products (Tofutti) weren&#039;t required.  But hen again, that&#039;s easier said than done.

Great inspiration!</description>
