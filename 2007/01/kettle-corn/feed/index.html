		<description>I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s regional. My friend and dorm-mate introduced it to me in college and I was hooked!</description>

		<description>Mamafabun - This was actually the first time I had kettle corn!  I always see caramel corn for sale instead.  I wonder if it&#039;s a regional thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Springsandwells - Thanks for your kind words.  I just realized that you have a vegan food blog too!  Awesome!</description>
