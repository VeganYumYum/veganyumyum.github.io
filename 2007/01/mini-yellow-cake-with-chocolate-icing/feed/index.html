		<description>We LOVE your cookbook.  OH~ I own a licensed vegan home bakery in ME...not TOO far from Boston.  ;o)  If you&#039;re ever in the state, I&#039;d love to swap ideas.    ~ We tried your vegan &quot;egg sandwiches&quot; and were just amazed!  My 4yr old loved them, made bagel sandwiches with your maple tofu triangles.  Thank you!!</description>

		<description>Good looking cake! 

I personally think you&#039;re best doing two separate layers instead of slicing them - even though I like to think I can slice well, the two layers often comes out better in the end

Keep having fun with baking!</description>

		<description>Wonderful , I love little desserts &amp; yours are great. Very impressive. I look forward to trying some of your recipes. You need to find a cake decorating/supply store in your area , should have 6&quot; rd boards and boxes for storage and transportation of your little creations.</description>

		<description>I heard the tip about the coat hanger years ago- it&#039;s a good one! Another good tip - if you want to have your cookbook flat and keep it clean, place a pyrex pie plate or cake plate on your recipe book- you can read through it and it holds your book open.</description>

		<description>Hey there! Just discovered your AMAZING blog, soooo many recipes I want to try...boy howdy. This cake is beyond adorable-- and I thought I&#039;d share a storage tip so your next one doens&#039;t get smooshed by saran wrap! Use an upside-down tupperware container to store baked goods-- you put the cake on the upside-down lid, then lower the bowl part over the cake and click into place. It&#039;s airtight for freshness, but the frosting won&#039;t get ruined. This trick has saved me many times...but maybe you&#039;re not as OCD as I am-- ha!</description>

		<description>Thank you for the coathanger idea - I&#039;ve tried it a few times since reading this post last week, and it&#039;s so convenient and might just keep my favourite books (like VCTOTW and VWAV) from becoming more food-encrusted.</description>

		<description>I just tried it!  My favourite kitchen supply place only had 4&quot;/10cm springform pans, so mine are slightly smaller than the ones you used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I halved the recipe -- in other words, used six cupcakes&#039; worth of batter -- and didn&#039;t even need to trim the cakes afterwards, since they rose so evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger won&#039;t let me post pics in a reply, so I&#039;ll send them to you separately :-)</description>

		<description>Wow, thanks everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia - I made &quot;one batch&quot; of cupcakes and had enough batter left over for 4 regular sized cupcakes.  I  baked it at the same temperature, but it took about 30 minutes to bake all the way through.  I&#039;d check it after 25 minutes and see where it&#039;s at.  :)</description>

		<description>Oh, and did you use the same cooking time (20 to 22 minutes) and temp (350F)?</description>

		<description>This look so yummy!  Quick question:  Did you only use one batch (i.e., enough batter for 12 cupcakes) of the recipe for your two 4.5&quot; springform pans?</description>
