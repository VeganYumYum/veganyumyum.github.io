		<description>Hi, I just wanted to share my interpretation of your salad--also in the spirit of happy accidents!

I was searching for &quot;kale salad&quot; on google because I had a huge bunch of kale in my fridge. Bought all the ingredients, but came home and the kale had gone bad already! Instead I used spicy baby arugula and used it raw like a regular salad, and I had a ripe avocado in my fridge so I cut that up and added it too. Its really delicious and fruity but not overly sweet and the avocado adds a nice bit of substance.

Thanks for posting this salad! Next time I have kale I want to try the &quot;real&quot; version.</description>

		<description>Oh my goodness!  I am going to shop for some of these recipes tonight, these dishes look amazing.  I&#039;ve been looking at a lot of vegan blogs since most of my friends are vegan but it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve felt so excited about cooking for them.  Thank you so much!</description>

		<description>Hi, I found your blog via Isa&#039;s cupcakes blog. All your food is beautiful! This looked really easy, so I tried a variant of it last night -- southern greens and redcurrants. It was excellent, and very easy. Thanks!</description>

		<description>Thanks!  I didn&#039;t even realize when I was putting it together that iron + vitamin C makes it a pretty healthy salad, too.  Maybe my body is trying to make up for all those cupcakes.  :)</description>
