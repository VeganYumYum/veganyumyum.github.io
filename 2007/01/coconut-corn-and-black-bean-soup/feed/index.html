		<description>I have a one and a half year old daughter who can&#039;t get enough of this.  She would eat it every day if she could, and her portions are almost as big as mine.  It was the inspiration for one of her favourite words....beans!  

I always keep these ingredients on hand now so that I can make a quick supper in a few minutes.  Add a couple of slices of bread, and maybe a salad if we have some vegetables around, and it&#039;s a great, filling and complete meal after a day out.</description>

		<description>I made this tonight - the first soup I&#039;ve ever made!  The only stewed tomatoes I could find were all seasoned, so I used pureed tomatoes, which may have given too strong a flavor - I had to use extra coconut milk, and I added curry powder.  I used red lentils rather than corn, which worked wonderfully.  It actually made about 5 servings for me, and having finished one a little while ago, I am incredibly full!  Quite tasty.  Thanks!  Now to find a use for the left-over tomato puree and coconut milk...</description>
