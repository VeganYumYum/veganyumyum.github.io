		<description>I love this pie and make it all the time!  However, it doesn&#039;t show up on the Vegan Yum Yum iPhone application.  Any chance that could be fixed?  Thanks and much appreciation for this lovely recipe.</description>

		<description>Wow! I made this yesterday- and it was fantastic! I used my Vitamix and the filling was perfect. I didn&#039;t have enough pistachios, so I mixed in some granola with them. The filling is so good I think next time I may just fill mini phyllo cups with it. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.</description>

		<description>Wow, this looks great.  The Elephant Walk in Cambridge made vegan avocado and white chocolate mousse for my wedding rehearsal dinner--it was really amazing.  Your experimentation here has re-inspired me to create something like it.

I&#039;ve never used the PPK forums, but it would be great to meet other creative, fun, greater-Boston vegans who love to cook (I&#039;m in Somerville).  Next time there&#039;s a gathering, I&#039;d love to contribute!</description>

		<description>That looks so interesting.. I&#039;ll bet it&#039;s delicious. I&#039;m going to copy this recipe and if I ever make it, I&#039;ll let you know.. (I&#039;m trying to lose weight, so it may be a while.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking through your blog and your Kale and Blackberry salad looks to die for. Absolutely stunning presentation.</description>
