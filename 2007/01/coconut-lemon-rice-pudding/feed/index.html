		<description>are you sure you cooked this at 250?  i let it sit at 250 for 90 mins and nothing happened-- hard rice in a warm puddle.  i cranked it up to 350 and it got mostly cooked... i used brown rice.  not sure what happened.  very tasty though :)</description>

		<description>This looks wonderful. I have some coconut milk I&#039;ve been meaning to put to use. Do you use cooked or uncooked rice to start with?</description>
