		<description>Your idea of just buying the best vegetables without knowing exactly what they are is encouraging to me.

We get so locked into what is or isn&#039;t good without learning to explore a bit.

I love beets when stewed. Try adding a little honey to diminish the bitter ones though.

Help this helps.</description>

		<description>Beets taste great roasted with rosemary and extra virgin olive oil.  Wish I could have been behind you in the check out line we love kohlrabi and usually eat it raw but its great stewed as well:-))</description>

		<description>Ok, I just read your comment about juicing with the beets.  It&#039;s really very good in juice, if you don&#039;t over due it, which is easy to do, because beets tend to overpower, don&#039;t they?  I used to work at a juice bar, and I would recommend juicing about 4 carrots, 1/4 beet and 1/4 - 1/2 lemon.  A carrot, beet, lemon blend is one of my favorites.  

xoxo
Amy

P.S.  Try carrot, apple and ginger if you haven&#039;t already.  :-)</description>

		<description>You really should just jump in and try beets! They are a very tasty, dynamic vegetable. I don&#039;t know what &quot;earthy&quot; flavor dianne is talking about, maybe she didn&#039;t peel them. Beets are actually one of the sweetest vegetables available, good roasted, curried, boiled, even in pasta!</description>

		<description>I just learned what kohlrabi was this fall.  I agree, it does taste good raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, mashed rutabaga is one of my husband&#039;s favorite sides, and I&#039;ve got to say it is pretty tastey.  They take longer than potatoes to soften up, but otherwise it&#039;s pretty much the same deal.</description>

		<description>vegyogini - Thanks!  I think that&#039;s what I&#039;ll do with the turnips!!  Sound delicious, but then again, I&#039;m a sucker for maple syrup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;springsandwells - That&#039;s the rough plan I had for the veggies - we must be on the same wavelength.  I definitely want to try the kohlrabi raw, but I&#039;m debating between a soup and a vegan remoulade for the celery root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June - Yay for delurking!  Thanks for the kind words.  :)</description>

		<description>Yummy!&lt;br /&gt;I totally love your blog! Your pictures are so beautiful, and I love reading all your different posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with the veggies... I&#039;ve made some nice soups with celery root, great roasted veggies with rutabega and potatoes, and I like kohlrabi raw with dip or in salad.</description>
