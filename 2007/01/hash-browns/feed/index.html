		<description>This is how I brown my hash browns too! But I was looking on line for a recipe that could tell me how to make them fresh from potatoes. I grew up with freezer hash brown potatoes and just found out this year that people actually grate their own potatoes. Your recipe ommitted this step. Could you explain it to me? Thanks.</description>

		<description>this looks wonderful and i can&#039;t wait to try it! thank you so much.

although if i were to make one suggestion, it would be that perhaps a rice cheese would do better than tofutti as they generally tastier and melt wonderfully.</description>

		<description>Undercooked hashbrowns are an abomination. Yours look perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only ever eat hashbrowns at home; restaurants just don&#039;t make them crispy enough to my taste.</description>
