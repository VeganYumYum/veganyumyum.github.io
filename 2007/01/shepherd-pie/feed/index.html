		<description>Yummy! This sounds fantastic. I&#039;ve always wanted to try Shepards Pie(probably because of Harry Potter haha), but was turned off by the kidneys and such used in the traditional version, so I never tried it in my omni days.

This vegan version sounds absolutely amazing, and I can&#039;t wait to try it :)</description>

		<description>i know i am totally commenting on a 2 year old entry - but that bechamel sauce would be perfect for a vegan Moussaka.  Veganomicon has a recipe that involves tofu and pine nuts.  Yummy, but kind of a pain to make.</description>

		<description>Mine was loosely based on a recipe in &quot;125 Best Vegetarian Slow Cooker Recipes.&quot; I used brown lentils, mushrooms, onions, carrots, sweet potato and lots of thyme and cracked peppercorn. Then I used soymilk and Earth Balance for the mashed potato topping.</description>

		<description>Mamafabun - that&#039;s so funny!  Lentil shepherds pie sounds delicious!  Stewart and I were discussing the variety of shepherds pie recipes out there - what do you put in yours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel - Thank you!  This is the first time I piped the mashed potatoes on top, and I think it was worth the effort!  (It was fun, too, but that&#039;s just because I&#039;m obsessed with piping things.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Springsandwells - Thanks!  I&#039;m sure yours was lovely!  I had no idea so many people were making shepherds pie recently.  :)</description>

		<description>Holy Beauty!&lt;br /&gt;That is so gorgeous... even on the plate it looks amazing and tasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made one recently too, but it didn&#039;t look that nice - on top or inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good work!</description>

		<description>Mine tasted great but yours looks much prettier. I made mine in the slow cooker so the stew part was pretty much just brown.</description>
