		<description>[...] Avocado Hummus Cucumber Sandwich This was a very simple supper, but I loved it. Luckily Ryan was out this night because he doesn&#8217;t like avocado or hummus. Strange! Serve with some pita chips on the side. Yum! Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:LikeBe the first to like this post. [...]</description>

		<description>I made these sandwiches for dinner earlier this week. Yum! I made a basil hummus from a new-to-me recipe and didn&#039;t really care for it. The sandwich was still really good! We&#039;re going to try it again with a chipotle hummus or something with a bit of kick. Thanks for the recipe!</description>

		<description>Oh my God, this is delicious. I just had cucumber, avocado, cilantro and hummus in my fridge and I thought to myself, &quot;I wonder if I can turn these all into something.&quot; THANK YOU for this recipe!!! :)</description>

		<description>Great improvising! I didn&#039;t have hummus (and I was too lazy to make it) so I did a little variation; instead I used two wholemeal bread slices, avocado slices, thinly sliced plum tomatoes, and vegan basil mint pesto (which I had in the freezer - I used the Post-Punk recipe). It was amazing! But I have to say I could have eaten more than one... Thanks!</description>

		<description>I just dropped in here to say that you&#039;re brilliant! I usually eat cereal as a meal. Also, I&#039;m trying to start a knitting blog, though clearly it&#039;s not coming along quite yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aasa</description>
