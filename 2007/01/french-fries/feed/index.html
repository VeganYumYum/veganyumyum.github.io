		<description>Samurai sauce in Belgium is usually just just mayo and sambal oelek.  It&#039;s a 3:1 ratio.  Use soy mayo and enjoy the pommes frites.  

ps I love your blog!</description>

		<description>I just came across your site while searching for &#039;samurai sauce&#039; intending to veganize the recipe, but I see that you two were already thinking of it!  Any luck???  It&#039;s SSOOOOO good on fries (frites), and since I&#039;ve moved from Belgium I miss it!</description>

		<description>Let me know, I&#039;ll see if I can come up with something close, though having never tasted it before it might be a bit of a shot in the dark!  You should come up with a recipe and share it with me, so I know it&#039;s right!  :)</description>

		<description>mayo based, some sort of chopped hot peppers, and I don&#039;t know what else.  I&#039;ll have to pick up a jar in the grocery store and translate the ingredients!</description>

		<description>Thanks karena! I&#039;ll have to look into a vegan version of samurai sauce.  What do you put into it traditionally?  It&#039;s mayo based, right?</description>

		<description>These look fantastic!  Here (Belgium) we call them frites, and seeing this has given me such a craving.  You wouldn&#039;t happen to know a vegan version of samurai sauce, would you, as that&#039;s the perfect topping?   I just found your blog yesterday, and can&#039;t tell you how many things I want to try.  Your pictures are fabulous!  Thanks for all the great ideas.</description>
