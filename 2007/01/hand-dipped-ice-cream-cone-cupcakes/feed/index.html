		<description>The vegan cupcakes take over the world icing is fantastic!  We can&#039;t have soy, either, so I just use Spectrum shortening in mine, and we love the result.  I serve my cupcakes to &quot;normals&quot; and have gotten nothing but raves about them.  I have to admit, though, mine never comes out anywhere near as stiff as yours.  I&#039;ll have to up my powdered sugar amount and give it a whirl.  Thanks for the ideas!</description>
