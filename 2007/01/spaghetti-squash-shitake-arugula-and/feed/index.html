		<description>How long should a spaghetti squash be cooked in a pressure cooker?  

I boiled mine tonight in the only pot that would fit it: my pressure cooker.  It was taking so long that I finally put the lid on.  I was afraid to overcook it, so I didn&#039;t really let it get up to full pressure.  

My guess is that if you brought it up to pressure, then let it come down naturally, it would be done.</description>

thanks!</description>

		<description>Oooo, I&#039;ve been looking for a homemade dipping sauce.  My favorite spring roll is with a piece of romaine, some fresh mango, sticky rice and some avocado.  Yum.</description>

		<description>[...] A beautiful Arugula Salad with Beets and Goat Cheese from Eliseâ€™s never-ended supply of perfect recipes. Catherine and I are on the same page pairing pasta with arugula and cheese â€“ check out her Strozzapreti with Arugula and Arina Goat Gouda. Urban Vegan makes a full-flavored Rasta Pasta without the cheese. Fantastic! And if VeganYumYum ever invited me over Iâ€™d eat a good bakerâ€™s dozen of these Spaghetti Squash, Shitake, Arugula and Pistachio Spring Rolls  [...]</description>
