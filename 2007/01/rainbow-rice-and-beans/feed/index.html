		<description>I started with this recipe and more or less doubled the spices &amp; soy sauce, and added pomegranate molasses for some sweet tang.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/susank/446793209/in/set-72157594534827649/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s a photo and explanation.&lt;/a&gt;</description>

		<description>Yum. This looks delicious.

I am kind of a lurker here. (I follow pretty much everyday, but never comment. Haha)

BUT on an off topic note, I was looking through your Flikr stream &amp; I saw your picture of the mushroom seitan stroganoff. Do you have the recipe for that?! I searched your blog, but no luck. It looks so good.

You can email it to me, if you do have it still. :D

Thanks for keeping up this amazing blog. It keeps me drooling. ;)</description>
