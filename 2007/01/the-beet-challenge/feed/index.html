		<description>Hi I never liked beets either but after a friend made roasted golden beets I was hooked. Red beets often taste of iron which turns some people off, I recommend trying golden beets or striped beets if you can find them. Roasting in olive oil and S&amp;P is quick easy and quite tasty. I also highly recommend the Roasted Beet Risotto recipe in Vegan Italiano, by Donna Klein. Not only isit a great recipe with any kind of beets I find the book indispensible.</description>

		<description>First, thank you for your site - the recipes and photos are inspiring and my husband and I have been thrilled with all of the Vegan Yum Yum kitchen adventures we&#039;ve made and devoured so far.

I don&#039;t have a beet recipe of my own yet, but I did just find an amazing beet jelly at a local market recently. I have used this up as a sandwich spread, on perogies, and  a mix of things so far and &#039;tis a tasty surprise. You may want to make your own... The ingredients include sugar, beets, distilled vinegar, apple pectin, and Italian heritage garlic. Or you may want to investigate

I don&#039;t know the makers - I just share a province with them - but you may be able to order online from the US.

Happy beets!</description>

		<description>beet ravioli!  tasty, pretty, beetastastic.  I roast beets with maple syrup, olive oil and garlic.  When they are soft and have that lovely roasty vegetable quality, remove from oven and allow to cool.  Then combine beets with some toasted walnuts, a splash of balsamic vinegar, a sprinkle of vegan parm (if you&#039;re so moved) and (if you&#039;re a fan like me) more garlic.  Spoon the filling onto your favorite ravioli, seal and boil as usual.  I serve with this a sage walnut pesto.</description>

		<description>Do you have the cookbook &quot;Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone&quot; by Deborah Madison? I LOVE the beet risotto recipe in her cookbook. The only changes I make are to leave out the lemon juice and the parmesan (obviously!).

 I can really recommend it.</description>

		<description>The email wasn&#039;t working for me so I&#039;ll post the recipe here. Hope that&#039;s okay!

Roasted Beets with Orange Dressing

1 bunch of medium beets, with stems trimmed

Dressing

2 T. orange juice
1 T. balsamic vinegar
1 t. dijon mustard
1 T. fresh herbs of your choice (dill &amp; tarragon work well)
1 medium shallot, minced
1/2 C. extra virgin olive oil
salt &amp; pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 400F. Wrap beets in foil, place on baking sheet and roast until tender (one hour or so.)
Meanwhile, make the dressing by whisking together all ingredients but olive oil. Slowly drizzle in oil while whisking.
Use a paper towel to remove skins from warm beets by rubbing gently. Slice beets into 1/4 in. slices and toss in dressing. Serve room temp. or chilled.

Good luck! =)</description>
