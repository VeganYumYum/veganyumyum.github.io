		<description>I made this tonight, but I added fresh mint leaves and traded the mandarine oranges with thin slices of mango.  

I also squirted fresh lime juice and a bit of shoyu onto the rice noodles.  yum!</description>

		<description>I have totally enjoyed perusing your blog site.  My, what a creative cook you are and your pics are outstanding.  May I ask how you learned how to create all these lovely things?  You mentioned never having gone to school.  And when is your cookbook going to be out?

God has definitely gifted you with loads of creativity.  God bless and thanks for sharing.  You&#039;re on my favs list.

		<description>I made these spring rolls yesterday and they were very pretty. I love the idea of putting in avocado and mandarin oranges, but I have to admit that my finished rolls were a little boring. I&#039;m thinking of adding some cilantro next time. Oh, and I only ended up using 1/4 cucumber and 1-1/2 carrots.</description>
