<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Stewart &mdash; It&#8217;s nice to meet you! Lauren wasn&#8217;t feeling well this evening, and when your wife is sick, you&#8217;re supposed to take care of her. You&#8217;re supposed to make sure that she has everything she needs. Failing that, however, you should at least make her dinner. So that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p>Walking home from work tonight, I had a plan. I knew that we had some leftover sourdough bread from last night, and I thought it was probably fairly crusty. Why not serve a thick soup with it? How about right on top of it? It would be some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, <em>bread soup.</em> I&#8217;m pretty sure I had something like that when I was a kid. Or maybe that was an open-faced sandwich. If you think about it, they&#8217;re on the same continuum. When I got home, though, I realized that I can&#8217;t just make a soup. Maybe <em>you</em> can; I know Lauren does it all the time. For a low-confidence cook like myself, however, soup isn&#8217;t something you play around with. It&#8217;s scary. You tell your friends, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make soup,&#8221; and they laugh at you. Then they realize you&#8217;re actually serious, and they do their best to change your mind. &#8220;Peanut Butter and Jelly is good, too,&#8221; they tell you in a consoling voice. Actually, I don&#8217;t have any friends. </p>
<p>I decided to take the easy way out and make something from Vegan With a Vengeance. Isa doesn&#8217;t offer any bread soups, per se, but she does have something called &#8220;Moroccan Tagine with Spring Vegetables,&#8221; which looked pretty good. February isn&#8217;t such a good month for spring vegetables, though, so I had to alter the recipe significantly. The result:</p>
<p><strong>Moroccan Sweet Potato Soup</strong><br />
<em>Serves Two</em></p>
<p>1 Sweet Potato<br />
2 Medium-Sized Carrots, diced<br />
1/2 Small Onion, chopped<br />
1 Lemon<br />
1 cup Frozen Peas<br />
1 cup Frozen Corn<br />
1/4 cup Raisins<br />
1 big handful Baby Spinach<br />
2 tbsp Tomato Paste<br />
1 Bay Leaf<br />
1 Cinnamon Stick<br />
1 1/2 cup Vegetable Stock<br />
1 cup Water<br />
1/2 tsp Salt.</p>
<p><em>Spices:</em><br />
1/4 tsp Ginger<br />
1/4 tsp Mushroom Stock Powder<br />
1/4 tsp Cardamom<br />
1/4 tsp Black Pepper<br />
1/2 tsp Tumeric<br />
1 tsp Coriander<br />
1 tsp Cumin<br />
Dash of Celery Salt<br />
Sprinkle of Chili Flakes</p>
<p>Saut&eacute; your onion in a pan with some olive oil. Once the onion starts to brown, toss in your spices and let them cook in the oil for fifteen seconds or so. Then pour in the rest of the ingredients, except for the corn, peas, and spinach. Bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer until the carrots are soft enough for your taste. Chop your sweet potato into half-inch pieces while the soup is simmering, and saut&eacute; in some olive olive until soft. Be careful not to overcook them, though; they&#8217;re going into a bowl of soup, and you don&#8217;t want them to fall apart. </p>
<p>The soup and the sweet potatoes should finish about the same time, but it&#8217;s OK if they don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re both very patient. Set the sweet potatoes aside if they&#8217;re done first, or turn the soup&#8217;s burner to low if they&#8217;re not. When the carrots in your soup are the desired level of softness, add the peas and the corn and continue simmering for two or three minutes. Then add the baby spinach and stir it into the soup until wilted. Depending on what kind of vegetable stock you use, your soup may need some salt at this point. We use vegetable bouillon cubes, for convenience, and they have a decent amount of salt in them already. Definitely taste before you serve.</p>
<p>Ladle the soup into bowls and spoon the sweet potato bits on top of it. Make sure you take the cinnamon stick and the bay leaf out first. Isa and Terry recommend garnishing the original recipe with lemon slices, and even though I changed it quite a bit, I think it&#8217;s still a good idea. Crusty sourdough bread and Earth Balance is also highly recommended.   </p>
