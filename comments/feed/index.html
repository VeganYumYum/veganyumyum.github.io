		<description>Wow. I cannot fathom a cook who does not like garlic, since it is one of the most fundamental ingredients in savory cuisine from virtually every region of the world. How on earth do you sample ethnic food and simultaneously avoid garlic? Well I give you credit for cooking with cilantro at least.</description>

		<description>Doesn&#039;t the Earth Balance Margarine contain Palm fruit?  The cultivation of Palm Oil and all of it&#039;s products is responsible for the slaughter of the Orangutan population in countries where they live.</description>
